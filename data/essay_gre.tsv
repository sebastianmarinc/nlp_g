A10XW6SNPNQX16	essay1	There will be a day where no one will rely on their own brain but that of a computer. I know it seems outlandish but it already is kind of happening now. Nearly everyone has a computer, smartphone, or access to one. If you want to know an answer, the world is figuratively at your fingertips. While it can dumb down people, I use it to learn new things. Before I would have to go to a mechanic or the library to learn h ow to change an alternator. Now, I can learn how to do it from the comfort of my bed, watching a video online.
A10XW6SNPNQX16	essay2	The major cities would have the most people to observe and learn from. Plus all major cities have a melting pot of people. I know personally, from living in Orlando, that you have all kinds of races, ethnicity, what have you. It's a great way to learn the characteristics of the main culture and then it's subcultures. You will see all of their homes, shops, etc.
A10XW6SNPNQX16	essay3	Yes, I agree, scandals help us in opening our eyes in realizing what is going on. Right now the greatest scandal is the #metoo movement. Yes, sexual harassment in the work place has been spoken about but it was nothing compared to the degree of what was actually going on. Now that all these scandals have been brought forward into the limelight, they can be dealt with instead of having the problem continued. Even though scandal is a taboo word, it does do good.
A110BZSDZN7E16	essay1	I have to agree with the statement as with technology, people are more dependent on it and less on themselves. It's now where technology automatically does so many things that humans tend to slack off on their responsibilities. The days of a person doing what has to be done have apparently fallen by the waste side and now we try to get it accomplished another way. While technology is good in many ways, it has made us more dependent on it and less dependent on ourselves. People used to be more into doing work and physical exercise but now they are more into playing computer games and other gaming devices.
A110BZSDZN7E16	essay2	It's true in most cases as major cities usually show the trends of what to come in the future elsewhere. It's very true in regards to fashion as once something starts off in a big city, it soon becomes the new fashion for the surrounding areas. Also, in regards to the economy as if the unemployment rates move in the major cities, other nearby will start to be effected and it just continues from there. No, not everything that takes place or occurs in the major cities will effect others but its a safe assumption that in the majority of cases, it happens. While small towns further out might not feel the effects, middle sized ones nearby almost always do.
A110BZSDZN7E16	essay3	Scandals are useful to an extent but not always in a good way. While they do point out what is wrong in a instant, they almost always affect several innocent people, and in some cases, a lot of people. Scandals bring to light something bad that happened in a frivolous or corrupt way, but only show you some of what actually happens. I mean, there are a lot of scandals out there that happen, but very few ever really come to light. It's true that some are exposed for what they really are but a good amount of them are never figured out, spotted, or uncovered. Sadly, with any scandal, someone always ends up being hurt.
A114INA2S32A8L	essay1	I am in absolute agreement with that statement. Working full time in the IT field, I see real world examples of this every day. Faxing, which used to be a common procedure has all but disappeared with the advent of email. I saw four young employees surrounding our one fax machine looking at it like a specimen from another planet, all offering their two cents on how it might work. On another front, my daughter rarely writes papers. She is going into 9th grade next year and hasn't hand written a report in almost two years. There are articles popping up on line in which a number of school systems across the country are debating whether or not to teach cursive writing while still others are debating on whether to do away with writing instruction all together. Pray there's never an electro-magnetic pulse, the entire next generation may lose their ability to communicate.
A114INA2S32A8L	essay2	"American inner cities are a gateway into the life of at least half of our society. While one might claim they are the forgotten wastelands of our country, others, in more rural areas, might accuse them of not wanting any help. Crime, violence, poverty are all abundant in our major cities, but are not a complete picture of our society or our values. But as mentioned, these are only a partial picture of our society. Outside of these major cities is ""fly over land"" where people are more spread out, and there lives an entirely different set of values. I content that one should look at a societies rural areas to see its characteristics."
A114INA2S32A8L	essay3	"Scandals can be useful in certain instances as long as the sources are to be believed. To have scandals run rampant without diligent fact checking is a disservice to everyone. Another benefit to scandals is they tend to involve the actions of the target of the scandal and not third parties. This tends to reveal the true nature of the target of the scandal in their rawest form. This form tends to be less admirable than the outer appearance that they try to project, but usually represents their ""true self"" which can be invaluable while making other determinations about things like credibility, honesty, integrity, etc. In the end, well investigated and verified scandals can be an invaluable tool in seeing the true nature of the people involved."
A12BPQY35PARUO	essay1	This is a fairly common belief but it is inaccurate as technology does not replace our ability to think.  When we sit down at a computer, we must still determine what we are going to do and how. Technology is a tool just as earlier humans used other tools to master their world.  No one would ever believe that the wheel made humans less able to think.  It simply made humans more able to travel and this in turn led to a multitude of new technologies and abilities.  While technology does make it easier to do things, such as math, it does not replace our thinking of what math is nor does it reduce the usefulness of things like math.
A12BPQY35PARUO	essay2	A city does hold a certain special place in a society, it is not enough to study only that and expect to find something that can be applied to everyone.  Cities gain a specific culture and this culture is relevant only to that city.  A person living in New York is very different than one living in Los Angeles but this is also true for cities much closer such as Buffalo.  To assume that a city is indicative of an entire population is not logical as there are too many differences in the cultures between cities and between urban and rural areas.
A12BPQY35PARUO	essay3	This can be accurate in certain situations but the problem is making inferences based on a small population size.  A single instance cannot be used to predict the behavior of a large population.  An example would be a murder in New York cannot be used to identify that all New Yorkers are murderers.  Another issue with this is that most people only hear the most sensationalized news and therefore, we skip over the large numbers of people who do not fit that mold.  Rarely do we hear good news on television and we cannot assume that the bad news we hear is more than a random occurrence in a population.
A12BTFPKFKKD2I	essay1	Technology has been playing a very large role in human existence for an extremely long time. At first technology was very simple, but now it seems to advance in an unstoppable way everyday. Some might argue that technology keeps people from thinking for themselves and making their own decisions, but this is simply not true. Technology is what empowers and pushes people to think more. With new technology, more and more is possible in the world. We see people inventing medical devices that save life, environmentally friendly means of energy, and new sources of food. When we use technology for these issues, we are able to make more. People live better and longer lives, the earth becomes better taken care of, and the disadvantaged in the world become more advantaged. Technology does not take away our ability to think, it instead allows us to think further. We can now ponder ideas that we were never able to imagine before. There is much more in front of us than we would have ever realized without the use of the technology that we currently have. When I look at technology, I see innovations and great minds doing more than ever before.
A12BTFPKFKKD2I	essay2	Major cities are host to a large number of the world's populations. These cities are site to many cultures, traditions, religions, and perspectives. People are not wrong when they say that many important characteristics of a society can be found here. However, it is not true that the most important ones are solely found here. Society as a whole is very large. It spans most corners of the globe and hundreds of countries. There are small villages and large cities, and it is important to consider both of these, as well as everything in between. By deciding that the most important characteristics or a society are only found in major cities, then so many people are removed from the equation. These are people with separate lives and ways of living. There are people who do not fit the standard mold of the major cities. There are millions of people in the small outlying areas that make up so much of the world. These traditions are just as important as ones in major cities. A way of life does not have to be the most popular one in order to be meaningful as well.
A12BTFPKFKKD2I	essay3	For some people, seeing really is believing. They can hear something a million times, but never really care to think about what they are hearing. This can largely be the case with speakers versus scandals. It can be easy to just dismiss what someone says. Why believe someone with no evidence of it? Why worry about something if it is not an issue already? However, when a scandal happens, everyone can see it. The proof is everywhere. It is real, tangible and in our faces. This kind of actual substance makes people realize that these problems do exist, because they are able to actually see it. Cases like these happen everyday where people are continually warned of an issue, but they ignore it until it breaks out into an actual scandal. Experts warn of things like over-fishing, destroying habitats, and global warming, but so many people turn a blind eye to these claims. But then suddenly, there are less of species, or you can no longer get your favorite seafood. Then you realize that it was true all along. It is very unfortunate that things have to work this way, but too many people cannot focus on more abstract ideas. They need tangible proof of it before they can ever accept it as fact.
A12HZGOZQD5YK7	essay1	I agree that human's abilities will surely deteriorate from them relying on technology to solve problems because they aren't using their own judgement to make decisions. The less amount of time people use their own minds and judgement to make decisions the more they will rely on a machine or algorithm to make those decisions for them in the future and heavily rely on it to make more and more decisions. People will become more lazy and looking for easier way to accomplish things. People will be come dependent on the technology for everyday things and then more important decisions. As technology gets smarter, people will get dumber because they will have less of a need to do things for themselves.
A12HZGOZQD5YK7	essay2	It's important that the populations in the major cities be studied because human interactions happen more often in cities. Cities have the largest population of people from many different backgrounds and culture. It would be easier to get an overall idea of what is most important to a society by watching the interactions in their day to day lives. People in cities are more likely to discuss a larger range of topics as well. Smaller towns and rural areas usually focus more on ideas and local issues instead of broader ones. It would be more efficient in collecting data from a major city.
A12HZGOZQD5YK7	essay3	I believe that scandals are useful because they point out what needs to be fixed. Like in the banking industry, something is always fixed once a scandal has happened because the scandal allows us to see what loopholes or errors are in the current policies or procedures. A single person or organization could never make a society as a whole or corporation focus on their own mistakes as someone being able to take advantage of them. It brings awareness to what needs to be changed or completely removed. The most useful scandals are the ones where the people are caught and we are able to get the details of how they pulled it off. Most people or companies don't realize there is an issue until someone has taken advantage of them in some way.
A12LXY8U7NHI7W	essay1	As a teacher, I have seen how technology changes the thinking patterns of many of my students. Many of them do not enjoy the challenge or difficulty of solving complex problems. They like technology, but not the effort that comes with higher order thinking skills. Since implementing more technology into my classroom, many of my students are quick to give up on a task that requires them to think for themselves. They are also unwilling to try and come up with solutions when they think they know the answer but are not sure. Students are more concerned with getting the right answer, then flexing their cognitive muscles and trying out new and interesting skills.
A12LXY8U7NHI7W	essay2	In order to truly understand a society, it's important to study a wide demographic of people. While many people do live in major cities, there are also many who live in small towns or rural communities. These people may have drastically different values and lifestyles from people in major cities. Therefore, just as we would study people of different races or ethnic groups, it's also important to study different living environments. Only then, will we get a true picture of a society.
A12LXY8U7NHI7W	essay3	While scandals do command a great deal of attend, they usually serve to direct attention away from major issues and events. It's more important that we look at and consider the major issues of the day, instead of the major scandals. Many political figures will use a scandal to distract public interest from more pressing topics. It's important as news consumers that we are mindful of this and not let ourselves be fooled by these distractions. We will be better consumers of the news and more empowered as a result.
A12MV66U9VGLQ1	essay1	It seems likely indeed that humans will lose some skills as they rely more on technology. We have already lost the habit, if not the ability, of doing hand calculations. Many otherwise well educated children now do not know how to write script having been raised to word process most writing tasks. But, the extent to which technology can limit our problem solving skills cannot impinge on our ability to think. Thinking is innate to humans; problem-solving skills come and go.
A12MV66U9VGLQ1	essay2	"We may understand something about ""heart"" values by looking at the architecture preserved in a major city. Preserving beautiful old buildings may tell us that the preservers care about their history as well as their great creators. Along a similar line of thought,we may infer the same things from the presence of museums and opera houses. Many other facets of importance includde"
A12MV66U9VGLQ1	essay3	With any speaker, including reformers, there is always the probability that the speaker's  personal bias may conceal important facts.Natural human curiosity does focus attention on scandalous revelations because with a scandal, by definition, facts are bared.It is an article of faith that we can not only tolerate the truth, but, as well , use the truth well when given a chance. Scandal gives us the chaanc.
A13HZKB2NGZP6B	essay1	I believe there will instead be shifts in how we think rather than deterioration. Take for example a calendar; it used to be that you would remember either everything to do today or jot down everything on your calendar. Now we have cellphones which can not only hold all your future events but also set up reminders to future events. Would our memory deteriorate due to not having to remember things we jot down on a calendar? Possibly, possibly not. This also means that there are more things we can be concerned about that aren't about immediate things, such as concentrating on work. Technology can take care of the small stuff and give our brains more space to be concerned about bigger things.
A13HZKB2NGZP6B	essay2	"I would agree with this, as major cities are ""major"" for a reason. Take New York for example; what does New York embody that represents the characteristics of American society? Diversity; there are an array of not only people but shops and areas that bleed multi-cultural. Money; many, many banks and financial institutions are located in this state. History; many historic events have happened in this city that had changed the tide of America forever. The major cities contain so much information to give a clear picture of what's important in society. It would also be easy to study such cities; many of them have known records of what has happened in them."
A13HZKB2NGZP6B	essay3	"I would disagree; scandals show that something has gone on far enough to ultimately explode. First of all many speakers or reformers are whistleblowers who expose these scandals in the first place. For example Harvey Weinstein was finally taken down for his sexual harassment issues by women finally standing up to him. Second of all, speakers and reformers have usually talked about these issues but were ignored. Going back to Harvey; his sexual abuses were long hinted at and allured to by many people before the scandal even happened. Scandals are simply a way for people who have been under abuse for too long to say ""I warned you about this""."
A13PXTFOXDCKBF	essay1	While I can see why people would disagree, this is unfortunately a true statement. People have been conditioned to let machines do things for them. They no longer have to watch their spelling, they no longer have to learn how to navigate. People can completely avoid having to cook food if they want, they just have to pop it into a microwave. People don't even have to read how to do things, they can just watch a video or an article with pictures for how to do it. Ultimately, people will lose many abilities that we as a society had 20 years ago due to new enhancements in technology.
A13PXTFOXDCKBF	essay2	I think this statement is true. Cities tend to encompass a lot of things we observe in a society. Cities can be used to detect patterns and statistical truths that can be applied to society as a whole. For example, how people commute from the job to their home. How people react to new home buyers in their area. How crimes and violence rises and falls in response to certain laws and policing methods. Overall, I think cities can be a useful metric for how we view society as a whole.
A13PXTFOXDCKBF	essay3	I would agree with this statement in the short term but in the long term I would disagree with it completely. While scandals can provide people with a laser sharp focus on the problems in our society they often do not lead to larger change. For example, while people may feel outrage at a murder or some other form of injustice, the outrage does not last long enough for people to create action. People may need to move on due to the exhaustion from dealing with the matter. People also have problems with attention spans. It is hard for people to pay attention to multiple scandals, they will often feel overwhelmed or tune out complete.y
A14BW0VB7AP4IG	essay1	"I agree with this statement. I was raised without a lot of TV or technology around because my parents were against it. As a result, I've never owned a television as an adult and I'm not heavily attached to my phone the way I see that other people my age are. When I interact with other people who use technology in a more typical way I find it depressing that someone can sit and watch TV nonstop for hours a day and annoying when somebody has to look at their phone every five seconds. I criticize my significant other for being like this and say things like ""You can't come up with any better way to spend your time."" In my mind people who immerse themselves in technology become mindless, uninteresting blobs with no creativity."
A14BW0VB7AP4IG	essay2	That's not necessarily true. Population may be more concentrated in a major city but that doesn't mean that a majority of a society's populace is located there. An equal or greater amount of people in a society may be spread out in more rural areas and just not as obvious as ones in a metropolis. I think any society has two sides that are mostly equal -- the side you see in major cities and the rural side.
A14BW0VB7AP4IG	essay3	I agree with that. Scandals are a reality whereas someone soapboxing about an issue is just talking in vague hypotheticals. Scandals bring drama and realism to the public in a way that resonates with them more and hits home better.
A14X9MMC9P7XI8	essay1	"I tend to agree that as people rely more on technology to solve problems that our ability to think for ourselves will deteriorate. My reasons for thinking this way are that in school we are told to solve math problems with a calculator now and not try to solve it by ourselves. Also, since so much work done in school is now done on a computer, there is no need to teach cursive handwriting anymore. This is a shame because children are having a hard time reading cursive handwriting because they are not exposed to it anymore. I also feel that people are slacking off in thinking because they know they really do not have to. There is a saying that says ""There is an app for that"". I feel like people think they can just look everything up in an app or on Google and it will be fine, there is no need to think anymore."
A14X9MMC9P7XI8	essay2	I do not agree that one must study its major cities in order to understand the most important characteristics of a society. There are many different types of society such as a rural, farm community. One would not understand that society if one were only studying major cities. There are many aspects of society that are not only found in major cities. There are also negative and positive characteristics of a society and again, one would not find them only in major cities. It is never a wise idea to lump together things that we must do (understand the most important characteristics of a society by studying major cities), there is always a different viewpoint and another side to the story. The same holds true for society.
A14X9MMC9P7XI8	essay3	Scandals are useful because they do focus our attention on problems in ways that no person ever could. A prime example of this is the timely issue of the #MeToo movement. If the Harvey Weinstein scandal did not break in the public forum, the #MeToo movement would probably not be here and at the forefront of the entertainment industry. That scandal will have a lasting effect, not only in the entertainment industry but on society as a whole. If a speaker or reformer had brought about this movement in a different way, it probably would not be as powerful and moving as it is now. Because it was a scandal at first, it was brought out into the limelight much faster than say at a conference or a convention. It might not have ever received any public attention if it were brought up through a conference or convention.
A159ZKL4AIHIS	essay1	I personally believe in the sentiment that as people rely more on technology to solve problems, the ability of human to think for themselves will deteriorate. The premise of my belief is that as people begin to recognize that there is a method that's easier and more efficient then brain power, they will surely utilize that method. Take for example texting. As people are more apt to text their friends or family members compared to calling them, the loss of physical communication is missing. This also goes to saying with humans aptness in utilizing computers to solve
A159ZKL4AIHIS	essay2	I personally do not believe that to understand the most important characteristics of a society one must study it major cities. There are diverse people in rural and suburban parts of state. Therefore, geographical limitations should not be set in terms of understanding important characteristics of a society. Also, one's geographical location does not automatically guarantee that person complies with that specific location. The aforementioned person could have relocated to the major city taking with them the past remanof their society.
A159ZKL4AIHIS	essay3	Scandals are not useful in terms of focusing our attention on problems in ways that speaker or reformed ever could. In fact, I personally believe scandals create an intentional diversion from the true story at hand. Scandals could be theoretically used to create a scapegoat for a more mischievous problem at hand - hiding the true story in disguise and fooling the masses. Scandals are also salacious and filled with ignorance. These characteristics only slow one's personal growth. Instead, a speaker or reformer should speak from the heart their message. Those who understand and want to carry that message will. Those that don't understand aren't meant to at that particular moment.
A16G6PPH1INQL8	essay1	As humans become more dependent on technology, we are seeing people depending on their computers to find solutions for problems that we used to have to find ourselves.  In the old days before the internet and the information age, we couldn't just do a Google search for solutions.  For example, my washing machine was having problems.  In the old days, I would either have to order a manual for my washing machine, hire a repairman, or try different troubleshooting techniques myself.  But, I was able to put the problem in Google and find a video that showed me exactly what to do very quickly.  I also believe that creativity could suffer.  Children are addicted to games and are not doing as much imaginative play as they used to in the days before elec
A16G6PPH1INQL8	essay2	I think to understand a society, it is important to not only consider the major cities, but to consider all the other smaller cities as well.  Many people who live in major cities grew up in a smaller city, so their personalities were well-defined by the time they moved to a major city.  For example, in the US, there may be a large percentage of people living in major cities, but if you were to take all the people who live in smaller cities and compare to the few major cities, you would find a larger percentage in the smaller cities.  The smaller cities are the backbone of a society with hard-working people.  If you want to discuss the humanities, there are just as many artists and musicians in the smaller cities as there are in the major cities.  And, may scientists and bright minds choose to live in a place where it i
A16G6PPH1INQL8	essay3	Unfortunately, I believe scandals are useful to focusing our attention on problems.  As humans, we are all naturally voyeuristic to a certain extent, so we thrive on hearing the details in scandals.  For example, look at the #MeToo movement.  Since the 60's, women have been trying to get focus on the issues that they confront every day.  There have been feminists trying to change the way women are treated but women continued to suffer discrimination in the workforce and other areas of their lives.  But, once we heard about the Harvey Weinstein case and we learned that our favorite movie stars were all complicit in activities that should be frowned upon, everybody took notice in a way that has not been accomplished by all the decades of preaching.  We naturally love to hear gossip no matter how much we try to deny it.  The women who had been suffering in silence saw this as a way to get a platform and they ran with it.  I think all this can be linked back to the Harvey Weinstein case
A16SAB417Y96G4	essay1	I don't really agree with this. Humans have seen technology changes for generations. When the printing press was invented, people used it to learn more. I think the same will hold true with new technology. We will continue to grow and learn and use what is at our disposal to do so. We may lose the ability to speak on specific topics, but as long as the technology is there, we can immediately see what the answers are to the specific questions we have, which will nullify that problem. All in all, I think humans will continue to think for themselves as we are very narcissistic animals.
A16SAB417Y96G4	essay2	I think there is something to this, but it isn't fully true. There's no way just studying major cities will tell you anything about the society. One great instance of this to point to is the views on the last election. If you studied the major cities, you'd find that Hillary was a shoe in. However, you are missing the entire part of the country that ultimately elected Trump. There are many other things you will only find in small rural areas. So yes, study major cities, but don't leave out the fly over territories in those studies.
A16SAB417Y96G4	essay3	I don't think I really agree with this. I don't really understand the line of logic. Speakers and reformers aren't the only way to gain attention. Scandals are useful for how they get people to come together and inside of an echo chamber on issues. I don't think that scandals are very useful though. They just show how bad human beings can be, and often skew people's biases. I don't like how scandals are politicized.
A16ZR6O5HQP5AM	essay1	In a time of globalization and high competitiveness as is the changing world modern, it is necessary to be aware of the various aspects that are part of our environment. Not only in the economic issue, but also in the political, legal, social and cultural By being better informed, the young professional can take better decisions, as you understand how changes in the environment affect you. The handle and Understanding information efficiently is one of the main arguments that facilitates decision-making in today's world, and is a key factor for success in life
A16ZR6O5HQP5AM	essay2	In the present article a theoretical proposal is outlined to understand the concept of value of use applied to the study of the city and the urban space, in its genesis and its development. Retrieving Henri Lefebvre's thesis, the main hypothesis is that the city, in its origin, emerges as use value. Following the approaches of Bolívar Echeverría and Gilbert Durand, we observe that the use value is not only material and sign, semiotic, but also, symbolic. It is sketched that the symbolic plays a fundamental role in the construction of cities, with an importance of equal transcendence that the economy and politics. A case study is carried out to propose a convergence of theoretical interpretations that go from historical materialism to symbolic hermeneutics. It is concluded that the city and the organization of its urban space are fundamental axes through which societies are organized.
A16ZR6O5HQP5AM	essay3	"Conflicts can be compared to an iceberg or a matrioska because when it comes to identifying them, the first thing that we have before our eyes is clearly visible (although this idea is also debatable since it is a question of perception that we will address in another post), which with only one look we observe and even anticipate to interpret. However, if we ""graduate the glasses"" and submerge ourselves to look with greater field of action, we will observe other aspects of the conflict so far unidentified, which are where the true essence of the difference lies and therefore, where we can look for the solution."
A171WYV1TRESW8	essay1	"I agree with the statement ""As people rely more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate"". We rely on auto correct, spell check, google maps etc. I love technology, but when we rely on technology too much it will hinder our learning process. There are pictures of people with their friends spending time, but they are all on their phone googling things instead of actually spending time with friends.  Technology is helpful everything in moderation. Too much alcohol"
A171WYV1TRESW8	essay2	I agree and disagree with this statement. Cities are good they are abundant with opportunity. Cities are not the best  characteristics of society. What about the Farmer who grows food for the masses living in the city. Without the people living in rural areas farming the people in the city wouldn't survive because they would be without food. The best part of society is not the city nor the rural farmer either. The  best part of society is the people that make it up. It is the culture and different backgrounds from each other that help us to make a great society.
A171WYV1TRESW8	essay3	I agree that scandals are good. We humans are the trickiest mammals on this planet. I'm not worried about the monkeys, I'm worried about you and me. If there is one thing we can expect people to be is human. So some people are evil, some are mean, some are only out for them selves and instant and self gratification. When we see and witness these scandals it truly shows some people aren't nice, they are not your friend and don't care about anyone but them self. Scandals remind us to be aware that everyone is not trust worthy and they only care about them selves and self gratification. We need to pay attention to our world leaders are doing and proposing, what laws they are tryin
A177EXELDLWTWV	essay1	The main issue with technology is that it makes people work less for the desired result. So they pend less time learning the basics. They have smaller reasoning abilities and have shorter attention spans compared to people back int eh day. technology allows us to devote our thinking power towards newer tasks. Instead of taking time to calculate a long arithmetic problem, we can use a calculator to do it in seconds and devote the remaining time to solving an overarching math problem. Technology enhances our thinking skills, instead of deteriorating it. Using technology does not decide our opinions on matters. Despite using the internet to answer questions, people still disagree or agree with the answers.
A177EXELDLWTWV	essay2	A society’s characteristics are defined by the attributes and customs of its people. If they are wealthy, a society is rich. If they are broad-minded, the society is tolerant. Therefore, can we label the experiences and traits of a small group of people, who arguably are in the best position the society can offer, as that of the rest as well? Would it be logical to assume that the characteristics of India’s metropolitan – Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata – are an accurate representation of the rest of the country and therefore, if someone was set out to study Indian society, these cities are all they should look in to? Absolutely not, because these cities do not speak for the majority of the population. The success, achievements, and stature of the top 2% does not hold true for the remaining 98% in society.
A177EXELDLWTWV	essay3	Arising scandals can be detrimental to society as they are distracting. Political issues such as the economic well being of a nation, or immigration in the United States usually take a back seat in comparison to scandals. In the United States, it seems that scandals take precedence in media coverage over important political issues resulting in mass ignorance over issues that truly matter.Yet some scandals bring about the nations focus on the rampant corruption of some individuals and companies. leading to greater social change,
A17AMTRIYI2Z2D	essay1	I disagree that it will overall lower humanity's ability to think for themselves. It will simply make people smarter at harder things. People won;t have to worry about the small stuff. They can work harder on tougher projects. Small distractions won't be in the way and they can free up their thinking. The more you have on your mind the slower it will think.
A17AMTRIYI2Z2D	essay2	I don't think that this is necessarily true. While you might find the most people in major cities, it doesn't mean they practice the most important virtues of society. I think you'd have to study small towns, suburbs, mid sized cities, large cities, minor, and major cities. That way you'd have a cross section of the country's characteristics and can figure out the what the most important ones are from that data. Not just a small subsection like a major city is.
A17AMTRIYI2Z2D	essay3	Scandals are usually bad. They are based on conjecture a lot of the times. While they may shine a light on dirty deeds, it's important to not get too prejudiced. I think a person who is reasonable can have more power and reach people more civilly than a scandal does. If they have the facts, ability, and confidence, they can speak louder than a scandal ever would.
A18G2CLYSTENK	essay1	It is my opinion that people will be the same in the future as they are now in regards to problem solving. People have always relied on others or outside sources to solve their problems. Whether it was a butler, a company, or some other source, people are lazy a lot of times when it comes to problem solving.  While people will be able to rely on technology it will still come down to the individual figuring out how to utilize the technology to solve their problems. The people who already lack problem solving skills will not be able to utilize the technology.
A18G2CLYSTENK	essay2	I do not believe that the cities hold the key to understanding society. Cities make up only one portion of the living environments on earth. Why would they hold the key to understanding society as a whole then? Towns, suburbs, and smaller populated environments hold key aspects that need studying as well.   People interact differently depending on the environment they are in. If data is taken from cities as well as smaller populated environments then this data is able to be analyzed as a whole which should give a clearer picture as to how society operates rather than just studying one part of the equation.
A18G2CLYSTENK	essay3	I do not agree that scandals are useful because they focus our attention in ways that speakers or other people can. People and reformers are usually the individuals exposing the scandal in the first place.   The scandal is the result of the action, not the cause. Without having people, speakers, reformers etc to focus our attention in the first place the scandal will never come to light. There cannot be scandals without he people willing to step up and speak out against the things they agree with. People expose information all the time and it is not labeled as a scandal. A scandal is only the interpretation of the event.
A19UBZFVUWL1ES	essay1	It is practically an evolutionary certainty that increased computerization and automation will lead to a decline in our ability to think for ourselves.  As the old saying goes, use it or lose it.  If we no longer have to do thoughtful analysis and solve complex problems, relying instead on artificial intelligence for example, then our ability to do such tasks will deteriorate.  Like any skill, problem solving and analytical thinking require regular practice.  Those who don't exercise their mind will see it atrophy over time.  Humans need to find new and creative ways to stay engaged in their own personal time if their jobs will no longer call on them to think deeply.
A19UBZFVUWL1ES	essay2	I don't believe it is true that one must study major cities in order to understand the most important characteristics of a society.  In fact, I believe that the opposite is true.  Within major cities, there is a bias toward like minded thinking and living.  Only in rural America will you encounter the broad diversity of our population.  It is there that you will find the blue collar workers, farmers, fishermen, and others that prop up our nation and provide it with the food, clothing and shelter necessary for survival.  Within major cities, you are more likely to encounter elitists who are out of touch with the roots of America and the working class attitude that build our country.
A19UBZFVUWL1ES	essay3	Scandals are indeed useful in their own unique way.  They are outrageous by their very nature and often cause a visceral response among the observers.  They provide a single event that we can turn our attention to with laser-like focus.  Take mass shootings at schools as an example.  Far more youth in our nation fall victim to gun violence in our inner cities than do at any one mass shooting.  More people die by homicide many weekends of the year in Chicago than do in most mass shootings.  But these chronic conditions fail to move us to action.  It is the isolated, horrifying events that capture our attention and rally us to cry for change.
A19XQH5DG3UO0	essay1	As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate. Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.  In the era of advanced technology, technology has undoubtedly changed the way people live. With the use of calculators, people gradually get rid of mental arithmetic. Due to this fact, some people argue that the ability of humans to think for themselves will undoubtedly decline. This is because when relying excessively on instruments, people may hardly figure out the right number without calculators if the calculation becomes somewhat complicated.  Admittedly, it is true that human’s ability of calculation might diminish to some extent. However, technology decidedly facilitates humans to think deeply for themselves through freeing them from trivial things. This is an indisputable fact that with versatile and state-of-the-art computers, especially mainframe, scientists no longer take pains to deal with complex and numerous formulas. Therefore, these talented scientists can spend their time and energy in doing more meaningful things by avoiding being bogged down with trivial computations. For instance, engineers who major in aerodynamics, can use the latest computers to simulate how the attitude of airplane will change with respect to different levels of wind. Thus, due to the assistance of modern instruments, these engineers can focus more on how to design planes to fly more safely and efficiently.  In contrast to the statement, we can see that people begin involving themselves in some more complex problems that did not occur in the past, which motivates humans to think assiduously for themselves. By utilizing technology, for example, people build large dams to store the water as well as preventing devastating floods. However, this approach also has led to consequences people never thought of. The Three Gorges Dam in China is an excellent instance of this point. After construction of this huge and marvelous dam, some unpremeditated problems emerged, such as undue fluctuations in temperature in local areas and sediments and silt deposited excessively under on the bottom of the Yellow River. As a result, this phenomenon forced experts in China to contemplate whether altering the local topography might negatively influence climate and to what extent. Therefore, humans’ ability to think for themselves has improved rather than deteriorated  In addition, technology also inevitably leads humanity to think of moral questions that did not appear in the past. One of the most profound and contentious moral questions is cloning. While cloning will definitely help sick people with deteriorating organs by cloning new ones, this technology is also likely to raise a debate of whether cloning is illicit or not. Will cloning finally crumple up our established morality, or must scientists stop doing research on cloning even if the advantages of cloning far exceed the disadvantages arising from this advanced technology? By answering these controversial questions, we, human race, are unquestionably engaged in thinking for ourselves.  All the evidence put forward supports an unshakable conclusion that although some human abilities, such as computation, are slightly worse because of reliance on calculators, the ability of thinking is expected to improve rather than deteriorate. On one hand, people, especially sophisticated scientists, will have more time to focus on significant as well as knotty problems. On the other hand, new questions that pop up appear as a result of technology involve humans in more profound contemplation.
A19XQH5DG3UO0	essay2	"As the good old clich goes, ""when you are in Rome, do as the Romans do,"" it is understood that Romans can be expected to behave in a manner that is represented by the city of Rome. In other words, the city of Rome reflects the characteristics of the Roman society. Is this true in the present world also? This clich may be questionable in the modern world because Rome would now constitute of people from various societies who have chosen to settle there due to various reasons like their choice of career. Therefore, it is now very difficult to understand the most important characteristics of any one society by studying its major cities. On the contrary, these characteristics could be better understood by studying the villages and small towns of the society where the traits and characteristics of that society would still be preserved."
A19XQH5DG3UO0	essay3	Scandals sometimes can catch public’s attention, and shed light on some issues that may be controversial and worth attention. However, I disagree with the statement that scandals can focus people’s attention on problems in ways that no speaker and reformer ever could, because it is possible that some speakers and reformers can focus public’s attention effectively just like scandals do, and scandals may not always focus public’s attention in a useful way.
A1A1A9UHNQCI9Y	essay1	While technology has made life easier, it will not cause the deterioration of thought in humans. This come from the position that it is in our nature to learn and that is mostly found in our interactions with each other and the environments around us. A person may be able to tell its smartphone to add an appointment to the calendar, but they will not be able to experience a day at the beach with that artificial intelligence. The power of humans wanting to experience the senses will keep curiosity and the ability to think for oneself n check of technology.
A1A1A9UHNQCI9Y	essay2	I would disagree with the premise of studying the major cities of a society in order to capture its characteristics. Surely, there is a large population from which to sample. However, the major cities do not tell the story of a whole society. With every major city, there is a countryside and in many places, a suburb. Each type of community has its own character, its own vices, its own virtues. In order to get a better idea of how a society functions, I take the position that it is best to study the various types of communities that the society has.
A1A1A9UHNQCI9Y	essay3	A scandal can bring well thought responses and even visceral emotions to problems that we are currently facing. While they help society to notice a problem, it does not lead to reform. For example, there have been many mass shootings within the United States. These shootings have occurred in churches, schools, and movie theatres. With every occurrence, people move for better gun laws, but they never come to pass. Scandals may be good to galvanize action, but solving problems require work when things are quiet.
A1A7KL0CEERE60	essay1	I agree that relying on technology limits people's ability to think, because all of the answers to any question can be found immediately.  People do not rely on their own ability to solve problems, they simply go to the internet.  People do not educate themselves anymore, they simply google for answers and accept the bare minimum of facts.  One of the areas that definitely show the deterioration of humans to thi
A1A7KL0CEERE60	essay2	I agree with this statement, in that the major cities of a society would incorporate many of it's elements.  It is apparent how successful a society is by studying these major cities and the elements such as people, income averages and disparity, architecture, transportation, and industry.  Many forms of industry and commerce will be apparent in a city in a successful society. There will be many forms of art and entertainment available, and the people will be gainfully employed and successful.  The cities will have plenty of parks and recreation and generally show it is home to healthy and
A1A7KL0CEERE60	essay3	It is true that scandals are useful, because they bring certain situations to light that have previously been hidden.  A person could speak on an issue or try to make general reforms, but when a scandal appears, the situation is clearly illustrated for all to see.  In addition, this gives leaders a chance to handle the issue and show a precedent in handling it.  Punishment is then public for all to see and understand.  All sides of the problem are examined by the public and conversations are started, in a way that people didn't understand before the scandal.  Reforms can more easily be made, once a scandal illustrates the problems involved in an issue, and people are no longer so resistant to change.  It would seem that everyone benefits from this, except of course, the person who is the center of the scandal.
A1AF6EW9YUMER9	essay1	I disagree with this prompt. Technology has developed over centuries to solve problems which humans have encountered, and this has made humans no less able to think for themselves. The invention of the wheel allowed early humans to transport heavy materials very easily. The Agricultural Revolution solved the problem of low food inventory and famine when hunting/gathering fell short. The Industrial Revolution gave rise to factories and mass production. The Technological Revolution, with the development of the microchip, gave humans access to the world at their fingertips. Whatever innovation comes next, there is no doubt that it will only spur the creativity of the human mind and expand what possibilities exist in human thinking. It may be possible that technology will eliminate the need for humans to perform certain jobs, but it won't impact the way we think.
A1AF6EW9YUMER9	essay2	I agree partially with this statement. Major cities are typically a microcosm of society as a whole. Cities are home to the rich, the middle-class, and the lower class. From penthouse condominiums, to mid-rise apartments, to homeless encampments, it is possible to examine those living in each of these dwellings to study the major issues associated with each class. Aspects of society which develop in major cities include stores, restaurants, sports teams, theaters, schools, churches, parks, airports, and more. There is constant hustle and bustle which allows for close examination of human movement, patterns, and trends.  However, to only study cities ignores a major part of a society. Those living in rural areas live lives that are completely unknown to those who have never left an urban or suburban environment. Farmers, ranches, and individuals who choose to live off the beaten path all play integral roles in society. Farmers cultivate food/livestock and participate in trade with other parts of society. SOciety would collapse without these functions. Therefore, one needs to study both cities and rural areas to understand all important characteristics
A1AF6EW9YUMER9	essay3	I mostly agree with this statement, though it describes an unfortunate truth. Scandals exist because those in power attempt to hide something which would impact their credibility if discovered. From political scandals such as Watergate, to sex scandals such as Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky, to scandals in sports such as the recent NCAA Basketball revelations, attention is paid to these issues much more heavily when these pieces of information are revealed rather than when a speaker expresses their opinion about it. With the 24/7 news cycle, it is possible to spend more time examining these issues now than it ever was before. Whether or not any reform is a result of these scandals is another story. There would need to be a huge push from the public or a significant risk of those in power losing their upcoming elections in order for action to be taken.  In general, people are attracted to controversy and intrigue. When significant issues are made public, attention will naturally be drawn there until something else takes collective attention away from these scandals.
A1BIN5R8FF4FQR	essay1	Technology has given humans great advances in many areas. We are now able to communicate quicker, solve medical problems more effictivley and gain information in ways never before immagined. However, this reliance on technology has also caused us to stop and think critically about the information we recieve and how we communicate that information to others. One example of this is spelling. As people who rely on spell checks and instant messaging with emoticons more and more we are losing the ability to spell correctly. All to often, we miss common words and leave out important grammer rules when using technology to get our point accross to others. We allow pictures to replace often used words and we do not correct each other when replying for fear of being a grammer nazi.
A1BIN5R8FF4FQR	essay2	While it is true that our major cities can show us a large percentage of the populations characteristics, you can not rely on only city people to show you who we all are in society. When trying to figure out what is most important in the character of general society, you have to go beyond the boards of the city. People in rural areas can show us a vastly different set of characteristics then those people who live in close quarters. The people who live in suburban areas also have a set of characteristics that are different than those who live in urban areas. In order to correctly understand the most important characteristics of a society, you have to access each and every part of that society and that means everyone, everywhere.
A1BIN5R8FF4FQR	essay3	In recent political times, we have been subjected to scandal after scandal concerning our president and the republicans that represent us. In no other time of history can it be said that our day to day living has been bombarded with news stories of the scandals they are creating. In order to survive this president and come out better for it in the decades to come, we have to examine how thee scandlas are helping us as a society. We are now more aware than ever of the cracks and problems in our current political atmosphere. We can see these problems and learn from them to create a better America goin forward. In no other way could all of these issues have come to light and been accepted by the population. We were not paying close enough attention to these issues before, but now they are in our face every day due to scandals. This has been the most effective reprogramming of America that we never knew we needed. Pointing out the failures as only a president can do by being corrupt is a blessing in disq
A1BNR1ZAF1QGWG	essay1	I believe such a statement to be true.  As an example, if we rely too much on machines doing math problems for us, then we won't understand the algorithms in how to solve various problems and won't be able to evolve our understanding of math as a whole.  As far as machines, it will limit us in shaping our mind day to day.  This could lead to a quick onset of dimentia and overall lack of mental abilities as we grow old.  We need to do things ourselves and not rely much on technology so we can have a better understanding of this world we live in
A1BNR1ZAF1QGWG	essay2	I believe this to be true.  The reason being is having such a high density of people in one area gives a better understanding of how people relate to each other.  This would give a better understanding of their socioeconomic conditions.  We would understand their culture and how it compares and contrasts with other cities and also smaller societies like in tribal areas.  By studying large cities, we can also understand modes of transportation which take precedents and the quality of their commercial businesses.
A1BNR1ZAF1QGWG	essay3	I believe this to be true because they allow us to understand things which are unprecedented.  We see shady practices that go on in one particular business and this allows us to check if such scandals happen in other businesses.  Scandals teach us about a person or people''s character in how they are morally.  We identify these problems and are able to learn from them and evolve our sense in doing things better.  We see how the scandals bring us together to reform and become better people
A1C7XI68SED8JE	essay1	I disagree with that idea. Yes, we don't need as much simple calculations bow. but the level of AI is far from being able to solve complex tasks. driving a car is trivial for humans, but machines can't grasp it. Art and creativity are too hard for machines also.
A1C7XI68SED8JE	essay2	that may be true. but larger cities are only the part of the population. You can't understand people if you don't see individuals in them. A good example of it is a 100 dollar street. a website where photos of homes are distributed by income and not by geography. we are similar but we are different.
A1C7XI68SED8JE	essay3	scandals to often are used to distract from the issues and not provoke them. modern media uses scandals to steer the thinking. there is the war brewing? let's get some more gossip to make population not mind the war much. There are economic problems? let's switch the thinking with something else.
A1CXB0JXEY20NV	essay1	Many human beings are highly dependent on technology in the present day. They use internet-connected devices to research and choose products and retrieve information that is available in other forms but more easily accessible because of information. An example of this is looking up and choosing a restaurant or products online instead of visiting or contacting them in person or getting personal opinions.There is also a lot of opinion sharing and influence made possible by the spread of mass communication using technology, and the voices of one are echoed in the voices of many. An example of this is the mass spread of political propaganda based solely off of opinions in the latest presidential elections. As these kinds of technologies become more prevalent and more deeply rooted in social culture, humans will become even more reliant on them in decision making. The platforms that spread the information will have more control over what information is available and how the decision making process is carried out. Human thinking w
A1CXB0JXEY20NV	essay2	There are many major cities that are filled with larger relative populations than smaller cities and contain an aggregation of the cultures near and far from it. However just because the populations are high doesn't mean that the characteristics that are important in the society are proportional. The behavior and characteristics that are prevalent in major cities are prone to be shaped by the lifestyle of living in such cities; things that are evident from studying these cities may not necessarily be important. For example the decadence that arises from capitalism and consumerism in major cities is evident by structures and commercial availability. However this does not reflect the values of the country as a whole. These characteristics that are mass spread because of population explosions tend to represent not the characteristics of the society, but the system that the society is endowed with living inside of.
A1CXB0JXEY20NV	essay3	Scandals are dramatic. They're surprising. They capture attention of masses of populations and are highly publicized. Oftentimes they're necessary because they call attention in such a way that they have shock value that forces people to action. The problems they address may not be evident because they have not reached a threshold that people can no longer resist or not pay attention to, and when the scandal unfolds the people are finally shocked into giving the warranted attention. There are notable examples of this throughout recent history, for example the Watergate scandal in which speculation of the national government was called to attention. Another political example is the leakage of the Democratic party's emails regarding the party's treatment of Bernie Sanders and the scandalous activity that was being partaken in. These scandals opened eyes to what was going on behind closed doors and made people think.
A1DABMXVWWL0TR	essay1	I believe that as technology advances, the ability to think for yourself is definitely decreasing. People tend to reach out to social media for their ideas and thoughts rather than coming up with them on their own. I see people spreading messages everyday that they have not checked or even really thought about. It feels like a world of Chicken Littles. And if you ask them to provide facts or where they got their information, you get FaceBook or Twitter. These people can't be bothered to check on facts themselves, they are just parroting everything they see that agrees with the way they feel. Right or wrong.
A1DABMXVWWL0TR	essay2	Major cities are diverse melting pots. While they are a good selection of demographics, they do not exactly mirror small towns or communities. I'm failing to understand how New York is a good sampling of a society and a small town such as Yemassee, SC is not. You miss the charm, the friendliness and the people themselves when you just look at the big cities. Small towns can't support things like subways and mass transport. The infrastructures are completely different and couldn't be interchanged. I think if you want to look at a society, you should look to the children. Are they being raised to be productive citizens or are they being turned loose like wild animals? Are the children being groomed for a beneficial life or a life of crime?
A1DABMXVWWL0TR	essay3	"Scandals are not beneficial. They draw attention and resources away from actual issues. I think a lot of times the scandals that are reported on are just that, something to take away from actual issues. They focus our attention on something negative and then the media seems to run with it. A lot of times the ""scandals"" could be resolved with cool heads and really getting to the root of the problem. When it's dragged through every media outlet and forced into your head constantly, it becomes something to tear people apart, not bring them together. It causes people to get angry at each other and each other's beliefs rather than the issue at hand, or even at the scandal itself."
A1DIW2K1J89CMO	essay1	The claim that the further reliance of technology reducing human's ability to think for themselves does not necessarily seem true. Although technology has made certain functions easier, it has not required humans to think less. There are still things humans must think about in order to survive. For example, humans have a reliance on food and water for survival. Because of this, when in need of sustenance, we have to think about where and how much we need.   Not only that, but humans need to think in order to solve problems related with technology. There are very few times where technology works perfectly at all times. So, humans need to exercise problem solving in order to work around technological issues. When using a search engine, sometimes the results do not reflect what is wanted. So, the search needs to be revised to reflect the desired information. This involves a high level of thought and adaption in order to fix the problem. This spans to other areas of Internet and technology as well.
A1DIW2K1J89CMO	essay2	Major civilizations show how they interact with each other through cities. In experiencing and studying major cities, researchers can determine what was important to that particular society. For example, one of the most well known characteristics in Ancient Rome was the association between purple dye and royalty. This would be determined because much of the royalty was housed in the capital, Rome. There, they could also see how this color was made, through an animal in the sea. This was difficult to acquire, meaning that it could only be used for certain people. Therefore, they used it for the most important people in society.  Another way that looking at major cities helps learn about societies is seeing what other societies they interacted with. From there, they can look at imports and exports, as well as how languages grew and developed. Trade is obviously very important in society, and looking at the relationships between different societies helps to see what is traded. It also applies to ideas such as mathematics or religions.
A1DIW2K1J89CMO	essay3	"Scandals are very telling about a society. A speaker can always point out if something is wrong in a society, but when a scandal related to the problem comes to light, it is hard to ignore. People can see the problem in a new way beyond hearing that it exists. One of the best examples of this would be the Weinstein scandal. Women and men had been saying for years, ""The entertainment industry creates a situation where powerful people can take advantage of other's dreams."" But no one ever really took notice. Then, this prominent member of the group is suddenly a part of it, and everyone sees that it is true.  But it is still not enough, because even still, it should not take a scandal like that to make people believe victims or notice the problem."
A1E46RNRQ6P18L	essay1	I think yes, technology is the one that moves everything nowadays and each day it becomes stronger, something that is created or invented by oneself has the ability to solve everything faster than us, as for example calculators or smart phone compuntadora among others things, I think that in a few years the world will be totally technological

A1ELSQD3B8GFGP	essay1	I believe that there is truth behind the statement that technology has replaced some of the need for humans to analyze certain problems. This is because we have created computers to solve certain problems. However, I do not agree that our ability to use critical thinking has declined as a result. In fact, I believe the exact opposite to be true. Computers and technology has opened a window to vast and numerous advances. Through the use of technology, we have been able to become more innovative.
A1ELSQD3B8GFGP	essay2	"It is true that there is a much denser population in large cities and one can learn a great deal by visiting and studying the people in such places. However, I believe that many large cities have become secular as cultures from many different places mix and coexist. Therefore, I believe if one wants to examine the characteristics of a certain society, then they should visit the rural communities, where influence from the outside world has been limited. In these places, a person can have a more ""pure"" picture of that culture. People who are more sheltered from others will have preserved their traditions more."
A1ELSQD3B8GFGP	essay3	"I believe that scandals come about because many of them are considered ""taboo."" For example, not too long ago a homosexual marriage was a complete scandal, and cause for great alarm to many. However, through the attention and publicity, we as a nation and society were able to come to combat the negativity around such ""wrong doings."" These scandals were able to shape many movements and reforms. The same can be said for Rosa Parks as she sat on the bus, causing a great uproar over segregation and the need for equal rights for all. Many changes in history can be traced back to a scandalous beginning that highlighted the need for change."

A1F1A2FXG1I6ZY	essay1	We have already seen that children are less competent in math after the advent of calculators. Options such as spell check make a good grasp on spelling less important. These advances definitely make things easier, but since they allow us a larger margin of error, they allow us to get by with less proficiency in certain skills.
A1F1A2FXG1I6ZY	essay2	As major cities contain a large concentration of a society's citizens, it is an ideal place to study aspects of that society. Additionally, cities often contain a diverse selections of citizens which makes it easier to get a good idea of the makeup of a society. In contrast, rural and suburban areas often seem to have a more homogeneous makeup which would make them less useful in studying a society.
A1F1A2FXG1I6ZY	essay3	When a scandal happens, it shows a concrete, real-world example of a problem. A speaker or reformer can talk about past events or problems, or may speak about issues in a hypothetical manner. However, a scandal happening bring sharp focus to an issue and acts as an example that everyone can learn from.

I believe that we have become giant deletion machines due to the ability to look us anything in the world at the touch of our fingertips. We all are bot more connected and less informed at the same time. The smart phone has given us all an awesome library at our disposal and we are all less intelligent for it. Afterall why would you have to remember or learn something new when everything you would ever want to know is at your fingertips.
A1F1OZ54G177D8	essay2	I now live in the middle of nowhere and in a very rural setting where people both know everyone and keep to themselves. It however was not too long ago that I lived in Chicago. Having a perspective on both I can say for certain that both places should be studied. The city has a totally different  perspective than the country. In the city society is very loose and you don't really get to know the people that you interact with. In the country people really know each other and it is more of a close knit community. So by studying them both you will have a more complete picture of what it takes to have a functional society.
A1F1OZ54G177D8	essay3	A lie can travel around the earth twice before the truth puts on its pants in the morning. Scandals although very popular and very intresting are just that nothing but a scandal. The news really loves to report on them and they really earn the networks money. Unfortunately they get tiring and bog down any useful information to the point where the everyday person really can not tell what the truth is. Scandals also have the effect on people that they will believe an initial report and once they believe it they are resistant to any new information which just perpetuates the scandal.
A1F9KLZGHE9DTA	essay1	"I agree with this stance as computers are now handling tasks that humans once had to.  Take, for example, the calculator.  Using it to solve math problems consistently would most certainly reduce one's ability to solve math problems ""in their head"".  Now, take this concept to an exponential when you consider the great number of tasks (with significantly greater complexity) that computers now handle for humans.  As technology advances, this will also hold true with word problems and such that rely on written context.  This will ultimately end in uber advanced AI that will destroy mankind.  I've seen a video on youtube with six different AI robots who are already talking about taking over and destroying us.  If we were thinking for ourselves, we'd put a stop to it.  This shows that computers and robots are already compromising our ability to think for ourselves on both a micro and macro level.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted ;]"
A1F9KLZGHE9DTA	essay2	I disagree that this is the case.  While major cities are obviously a major hub and will be an indicator of societal characteristics, the data will be skewed towards the inhabitants of major cities solely.  The people and places will only give a general idea of the characteristics of *that region*.  This fails to take into account the lifestyles and values of people in more rural areas which are often in stark contrast to urban dwellers.  Surely, in an effort to be balanced and develop a complete picture, you can't ignore entire swaths of people from different regions.  Who is to say that considering the major cities is more important or indicative of society than rural areas?  That's like saying that you can get a good idea of what there is to eat at a restaurant by looking at only the breakfast section.  What about lunch and dinner?  This premise does not hold water and is in fact offensive when you consider how omissive the assertion is.
A1F9KLZGHE9DTA	essay3	"I also disagree with this assertion.  The premise is unfounded.  It does not make sense to say that scandals are ""useful"" because they focus our attention on problems that we might not otherwise focus on.  The problem is that most scandals are related to ""mind garbage"" (as I would call it)...issues that are best left in the gutter and don't advance our dialogue in ""useful"" or meaningful ways.  Take, for example, the recent Trump scandal with Stormy Daniels.  Is it really useful to be focusing on a potential affair a billionaire had?  Many billionaires engage in such relationships.  The grass is also green.  This is pretty much a given and diverts attention away from significantly more important issues.  So it's less than useless.  It's counterproductive.  Focusing on such scandals diverts the national dialogue and is a cheap parlor trick used by the wealthy elite and the media.  Much in the same way that magicians use misdirection.  That might work for some of the masses...but I don't buy it.  Just because scandals focus our attention on problems...doesn't mean they're useful.  You have to consider what type of ""problems"" are being focused on.  The problem is the diversion itself.  I'm not fooled."
A1FO1SROGRL5RH	essay1	"I completely agree. Even from childhood where we were told how important our math skills were and that calculators wouldn't be readily available for us as adults in the ""real world"", now we have calculators on our smart phones with us everywhere we go. The thinking part has been eliminated for us. Technology is our friend and our enemy. The more we involve ourselves in allowing machines to think for us the easier it will become for us to rely more and more on technology and less on our own critical thinking skills. Future generations will suffer this issue more so than current ones because they don't have the solid thinking outside the box foundation that we did growing up."
A1FO1SROGRL5RH	essay2	Typically, I find this to be true. I find that the major cities of a society tends to be where major laws and decisions are shaped and enforced. Therefore, they trickle down to the other smaller areas and they shape the smaller areas around them. So, in order to understand why society is the way that it is one would simply look to the larger major cities to see what they are doing for the greater good of society and see how it affects the other areas. They also tend to influence culture, fashion and music as well because the trends tend to be set in larger more populated areas that surrounding areas tend to emulate.
A1FO1SROGRL5RH	essay3	A good scandal never fails to grasp the attention of the masses. People tend to pay quite a bit more attention where there is publically available gossip involved. A speaker tends to have a speech writer and their thoughts tend to be written with the best possible twist. More often than not they are generic and have no real heart or components of captivation for their audiences. A scandal tends to get society to sit up and pay attention to the salacious details and follow a story more closely where a typical speaker or reformer gets tuned out. A scandal people tend to hang on every word never caring if there is real truth involved.
A1GXFMAC759VRM	essay1	While technology is fantastic for problem solving in an array of different areas, human reliance on technology is ultimately causing them to lose their ability to think for themselves. One excellent example is in younger kids today. They are so reliant on auto-correct that they barely know how to spell without it, nor are they typically able to compose a remotely coherent sentence if needed. Additionally, algorithms are killing the minuscule amount of critical thought individuals once used. By and large, opinions are formed by whatever news or editorial opinions happen to filter through their facebook feed. And notably few will engage in any independent investigation to determine the veracity or accuracy of the information. Though it certainly has its upsides, technology is nothing if not a double edge sword that is currently slicing through our ability to collective reason.
A1GXFMAC759VRM	essay2	Like it or not, a society is generally defined by its major metropolitan areas. And rightly so. The reality is that population density in any given society is centered in these regions. As such, the prevailing shifts in any culture tend to originate within them and radiate outward. While this is certainly not to say that less dense regions in any given country are irrelevant to its overall makeup, they are certainly less impactful with regard to how accurately they represent the prevailing winds of change or baseline opinion than metro areas.
A1GXFMAC759VRM	essay3	While we all tire of hearing about scandals, it's hard to deny their usefulness as a tool for social change. They are typically far more effective than any traditional speaker or committed reformer could ever hope to be. Most recently this has been overwhelmingly evident in the arena of women's rights and general equality. Prior to the various celebrity scandals involving sexual harrassment the #METOO movement was little but a blip on our rhetorical radar. Now, however, it is on the tip of everyone's tongue regardless of whether or not they are even aware of what the movement itself signifies. And this is just one example of how scandals more generally galvanize support for critical issues that otherwise tend to fall by the wayside.
A1H72Y9Z5NJXDS	essay1	I find it very convenient to turn to a smartphone when faced with a problem that takes longer than a few minutes to solve. Whether it's calculating a tip, or using turn by turn instructions to get to a location, technology reduces how much effort it takes to solve problems. Even when it is a simple problem like calculating a 15% tip, people will automatically open a calculator app and find the answer there.   There is not an entire generation who grew up with the internet, and soon a generation which never used smartphones with its many conveniences. It no longer takes navigation skills like following highwatto go somewhere remote.
A1H72Y9Z5NJXDS	essay2	Major cities in American contain about half of the population in a small fraction of the entire country's size. Problems and changing attitudes can be observed and studied far more easily with a diverse population to choose from. Rural communities are much more monoculture and less ethnically diverse. Problems with society also show up in cities first, including job shortages, adoption of new trends and how society feels about the country's leadership. Large cities provide a convenient place for researchers to understand how widely attitudes and shifting tastes are adopted and transferred between groups. It is not perfect, since entire other groups might not get enough study, but it is harder to get to everyone.
A1H72Y9Z5NJXDS	essay3	Bringing attention to long-standing problems usually has limited effectiveness. A press conference or news story is soon forgotten as the news cycles continue to move along. Scandals like bringing attention to abusers in corporate America, workplaces and Hollywood came to a head with #MeToo. With such a widespread problem, using the voices of many has given it a more durable focus over many months. The chorus of these voices have impacted politics and different workplaces, giving low tolerance to complaints of abuse. Politicians are resigning and people are being fired. An argument against scandal is that some might take advantage of the attention and make false accusations. An accusation isn't the end of the investigation, but just the start. It needs to be taken seriously to solve the problem.
A1HGSSITI7GRQS	essay1	People already do rely more on technology to solve problems, such as when making change they used the cashier machine. We also use our phones to look up things instead of trying to remember something. We also don't need to look towards our elders, because we can always look it up on a computer. People also use technology as a distraction or enjoyment activity instead of reading and learning something. Technology can advance us in ways of course, but we are also being dumb down too.
A1HGSSITI7GRQS	essay2	Well, the major cities of a society definitely portray the characteristics of a society, I wouldn't say there are the most important characteristics of a society. I think the most important values and characteristics first starts in the home, which are usually outside of the major cities. The suburbs. Home is where we are taught what is right and wrong. Yes, the big cities do have homes as well, but there are a lot of businesses there as well, which point more to consumerism, which is not the most important. The most important thing in society is family and how people treat one another.
A1HGSSITI7GRQS	essay3	I think using a scandal to further one's agenda of what they think is the answer to a problem is a poor way to solve a problem or influence another to one's side. After a scandal happens everyone's emotions are running wild and that is not a good time to figure out problems. A speaker who can discuss ideas thoroughly, giving the facts to both sides of the problems is a better way to solve problems with integrity.
A1HIQZEC2ER7GS	essay1	In the era of advanced technology, technology has undoubtedly changed the way people live. With the use of calculators, people gradually get rid of mental arithmetic. Due to this fact, some people argue that the ability of humans to think for themselves will undoubtedly decline. This is because when relying excessively on instruments, people may hardly figure out the right number without calculators if the calculation becomes somewhat complicated.  Admittedly, it is true that human’s ability of calculation might diminish to some extent. However, technology decidedly facilitates humans to think deeply for themselves through freeing them from trivial things. This is an indisputable fact that with versatile and state-of-the-art computers, especially mainframe, scientists no longer take pains to deal with complex and numerous formulas. Therefore, these talented scientists can spend their time and energy in doing more meaningful things by avoiding being bogged down with trivial computations. For instance, engineers who major in aerodynamics, can use the latest computers to simulate how the attitude of airplane will change with respect to different levels of wind.
A1HIQZEC2ER7GS	essay2	"As the good old clich goes, ""when you are in Rome, do as the Romans do,"" it is understood that Romans can be expected to behave in a manner that is represented by the city of Rome. In other words, the city of Rome reflects the characteristics of the Roman society. Is this true in the present world also? This clich may be questionable in the modern world because Rome would now constitute of people from various societies who have chosen to settle there due to various reasons like their choice of career. Therefore, it is now very difficult to understand the most important characteristics of any one society by studying its major cities. On the contrary, these characteristics could be better understood by studying the villages and small towns of the society where the traits and characteristics of that society would still be preserved.   In the past, the major cities of any civilization or society were the economic, cultural and political centers of that particular society. These cities reflected the true characteristics of the society that they were a part of. However, due to rapid developments across the globe, now most of the major cities of the world are almost the same. This is because there has been an intermingling of various societies with people traveling far and wide in search of careers and better homes. Any major city of the world would now consist of people who may have varied origins."
A1HIQZEC2ER7GS	essay3	Scandals sometimes can catch public’s attention, and shed light on some issues that may be controversial and worth attention. However, I disagree with the statement that scandals can focus people’s attention on problems in ways that no speaker and reformer ever could, because it is possible that some speakers and reformers can focus public’s attention effectively just like scandals do, and scandals may not always focus public’s attention in a useful way.  I agree that under some circumstances scandals can focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could. Scandals sometimes make people curious, and encourage the public to look for the whole story of an issue. Scandals can also raise pressure on governments, and force them to address certain problems. In addition, scandals can direct public’s attention to issues that some people are trying to dissemble or unwilling to reveal. For instance, especially in a society ruled by autocracy, or where the public does not have the right to speak freely, scandals can direct public’s attention on problems that people are not allowed to discuss in public, and when it is risky for any speaker to speak in public. It is possible that scandals can place pressure on the government, and then the issue can be addressed in order to placate the public. In this case, scandals are useful since it directs public’s attention on problems that no speaker or reformer ever could
A1ICXZVLIZM6IF	essay1	I think this is true up to a point. We past the Electronic age, went straight into the Information age. Now we have arrived at the Age of Too Much Information. It's an age where fact and fiction collide. The internet tells us it's all good and bad for us. Eggs are in fashion, but now you shouldn't eat red meat. You are spending too much and too little time outside in the sunlight.   The ability of people to think for themselves came from the ability to synthesize raw information into knowledge and over time, process knowledge into a measure of wisdom. When you have too much information, especially conflicting information of unknown origin, veracity, quality and truthfulness, the entire.. train of thought gets derailed. (Sorry. No. Not sorry)   I believe that technology will be the solution to this problem because we need to leverage what computers are good at. They are marvelous machines for cross-checking and number crunching. An agent program could fish through the endless sea of data much more effectively than humans can.  Spurning technology just because we have painted ourselves into a corner isn't going to solve the problem.  We are tool users by nature.  We should use the tools we have available to us.
A1ICXZVLIZM6IF	essay2	Hmm. There is something to that, but I think it would be rather than to understand the characteristics of a society they must understand where a society IS in the general cycle of empire building rather than just the cities. After all, the great works of the pyramids and many great buildings throughout history were created in the dying light of an empire. It is often the legacy left behind by past rulers and past mistakes, like Ozymandias and the great empire lost to the desert sands.   There is something to be said about the way space is constructed, however. How cities use space gives you a view into the problems they had to overcome in the process. Japan is a city built on top of itself, fighting a rearguard action against the loss of it's traditional heritage.  Meanwhile, America had an entire continent to themselves that they stole in the typical human fashion of taking things. American cities are sprawling affairs that require cars to navigate.   Little wonder just which industries have all the power in cities in which cars are not a luxury but a /mandatory/ necessity.
A1ICXZVLIZM6IF	essay3	Also known as 'The Barbara Streisand effect' in which attention is often fixated on that which they don't want attention brought to. Intentional or not, scandals are always useful because it often is an emotional rather than an analytical reaction. Emotions are easier to control because people who are emotional are easier to predict. They may not think deeply about a subject, but rather react in a knee-jerk fashion.  But the question to be asked here is... useful for WHOM?   Scandal is a double-edged sword.  It is a tool that may cut you just as easily as it may cut an opponent. A scandal based campaign automatically makes itself vulnerable to scandal because it has legitimized it as a valid tactic. A whisper campaign such as often used in a political landscape is like a thought virus.  It is a concept, a contact poison of an idea. It's all too easy for it to mutate and spiral out of the control of the user.  Hence, those who would use a scandal to draw attention to their causes should beware that propensity for abuse.   It's easy to misunderstand or underestimate fire until you are one of the burn victims.
A1IS0218RVG60K	essay1	We are already seeing convincing evidence that this is the case, that increasing reliance on technology will lead human beings to have decreased capacities in various domains. An interesting example is children who do not spend time writing with pencils or pens and paper, but instead use tablet computers and televisions. The fine muscles of the fingers do not properly develop, and some extreme cases cannot even hold a writing instrument sufficiently. I think that this type of issue can be taken as a general example that can be extrapolated from, and that other areas of mental development will similarly be affected by over-reliance on forms of technology. As children who have grown up in these circumstances come of age there will likely be all sorts of consequences, including increased rates of mental illness and increasing unemployment.
A1IS0218RVG60K	essay2	To properly evaluate which are the most important characteristics of any given society, it would of course be helpful to know about major cities and the conditions therein. This cannot be considered as the whole story, however. Outlying areas and rural zones take up more space overall in most countries, and the types of people and jobs in these places are equally important. One definitely must study the major cities of a country to come to an understanding, but that is not the sole thing to look at. You have to consider the overall system, including agricultural areas. Without these sorts of perspectives included, you will have a biased view of things.
A1IS0218RVG60K	essay3	"The utility value of scandals can be considered as positive for some people who are not directly affected, but this is a somewhat callous way of viewing such situations. The actual repercussions of the scandal are usually quite negative, and we should never encourage such behavior inadvertently by placing too much emphasis in the news media on these types of events. While increased awareness of things like drug abuse, sexual assault or corruption can definitely be considered as positive, I do not think that many people would say that it was ""worth it"" for those negative events to have taken place. The increased information saturation of the digital age will only further heighten the contradictions of this process, as scandals become more ubiquitous and also easier for young people to recognize as something to be avoided. Increased awareness will have unintended consequences, in my opinion."
A1K0S514CEY1UG	essay1	I believe that because of technology humans are lacking a lot of different things. One of the things that humans are now lacking are the ability to think for themselves. There are so many outlets on the internet now that they can look for answers to make sure they are making the right decisions. Now people don't make a decisions based on what they want to do and what they think will happen they base it on the reviews of others. They no longer have the ability to decide what they want, they can now look online and have other people make the choice for them.
A1K0S514CEY1UG	essay2	I agree that the most important characteristics of society you have to know its major cities. I think this because the major cities can tell you a lot about the society of a place. It can tell you how the people are and how they agree or disagree on different things. If you visit both the wealthy and the unwealthy cities within you are able to see the differences within the society. You are also able to see the importance within the society by visiting their major cities.
A1K0S514CEY1UG	essay3	I think scandals are useful because they help us understand what is going on. They help us to see what is going on within someone and to know the true them. It makes us see more than what they want us to and more than whay they tell us. We are able to see the underlying of everything and how the person truley is. Without scandals we would not be able to see the real person.
A1KKEOGQK1QNYR	essay1	In my lifetime I have seen people's ability to solve simple math problems devolve because of the reliance on technology.  You can see it in the cashiers that make your change.  They can no longer compute change you will receive in their heads and get confused if you try to offer them anything that will make the change in complete bills.  They must look to the register and rely on putting in the numbers and waiting on the machine to do the math for them.  This is but one example of thinking being reduced because of thecnology.  Isn't it logical that other more complicated thinking will a
A1KKEOGQK1QNYR	essay2	If you want to understand a society you can look to the major rules it makes about values.   The layout of the major cities can provide clues as to those values. Are these values expressed in the design of it's cities? Are the cites laid out with the important edifices in the center or distributed among many buildings.  Are the seats of power centralized or dispersed?
A1KKEOGQK1QNYR	essay3	Scandals highlight major problems that might not be apparent to social speakers or reformers.  They are the symptoms that illustrate that all is not well and that conditions must be evaluated for dysfunction disease and disorder.  Like the body that appears on the surface to be healthy ad well functioning to observers.  Scandals can be indicators that unhealthy abnormalities are present below the surface.  Scandals are eruptions that expose disease while the surface appears normal and somewhat healthy.
A1LB9JOMFQ1UMG	essay1	I disagree with this statement because people will always have the ability to think for themselves. In fact, it can be argued that without having to worry about minute details that technology solves, people's ability to think for themselves will actually increase. For example, spell check has made it so that people can focus more on what they want to say than checking their grammar and spelling. Because technology has solved this burden, it's a lot easier to focus on more important things, like the actual body of the message. This is only one example where technology helps people to think more about others things, but there are others. In the fields of science and medicine, technology helps take on monotonous, repetitive tasks previously done by people so that scientists can focus more on their research. Therefore, as technology improves, the ability of humans to think for themselves will actually increase over time.
A1LB9JOMFQ1UMG	essay2	To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must take into account more than just its major cities. Despite popular belief, many people who live in a society also reside in the suburban and rural settings, which influence a society as well. For example, a society can be compromised mostly of farmers. The type of agriculture they have and the livestock they raise and plants they grow all play an influence on that society. If one was to only focus on the major cities, you would be neglecting that kind of information, which is especially important when you consider that they are probably feeding the major cities with their crops. It's also necessary to take the education of the society into account as well. The education that people in suburban and rural settings receive is just as important as those living in major cities. In short, there are many different factors that contribute to a society, more than just its major cities.
A1LB9JOMFQ1UMG	essay3	I think that scandals can be a good way to bring attention to an issue, but they are also ineffective as well. For example, looking at the #metoo movement shows that while you can bring attention to an issue, nothing is done to resolve it. Harvey Weinstein became synonymous with sexual assault after celebrities spoke out about their mistreatment, and many women took to social media to talk about their own experiences, showing how widespread the problem truly was. Unfortunately, nothing much came of it. After a few weeks and many accusations made against different people, the talk of the movement stopped. People stopped using the hashtag and people stopped reporting on it. While scandals can help bring a particular issue to light, they don't always draw positive attention. Many criticized the movement of making up stories against men to get back at them, and with no way to seemingly justify those criticisms, the movement faded into relative obscurity. While it had attention in the media for a little while, nothing was done to improve the response to sexual assault as a whole, and so scandals aren't very useful in the long run. They may generate attention for a little while, but they fail to initiate change, which is something that is desperately needed.
A1LXW53Z5S9XG	essay1	In both oppose and support this accusation.  Our brains may not be cluttered with phone numbers or address as much because they are stored in our phones, and not necessary to function.  That is true.  That does not mean are brains are deteriorating. It simply means there is space for other things.  An example would be we are more likely to recall our state representatives name or who won the Super Bowl last season.  However, if we don't know this answer we don't have to guess.  We simply Google it and then we are more likely to know the answer next time.  Information at our fingertips makes us smarter in the short and long term.  If it makes us weaker in any aspect it is personal communication.
A1LXW53Z5S9XG	essay2	Why would one have to study in a major city.  More people live in rural areas and suburbs than major cities.  Most crime and news worthy events happen in the big city, but the majority of people never take place in those newsworthy events.  If anything the big cities are a misleading representation of an true American lifestyle.  American life is about hard work, family life and a sense of community.  The average American travels to the city to have life experience and then travels back home.  If you want to understand society, spend time on a farm, at a small local business or a school of 700 kids.
A1LXW53Z5S9XG	essay3	I disagree.  What makes a scandal a scandal.  It is simply a distraction from what is really important in today's society.  We are so quick to focus all of our attention on a single political figure for something they may or may not have done decades ago.  At the same time congress is passing bills that affect our present day lives.  We need to learn to live for the day and not focus on yesterday's negatives.  If a situation is ongoing and current, let those individuals deal with it in the courts and give everyone in the situation the privacy they deserve.  How many athletes that Larry Nassar abuse had their names mentioned but what they really wanted was to live their lives without the knowledge of what happened.  Scandals are created by journalist who are looking for nothing but a paycheck and are read by bored people that do not have lives of their own.
A1MJFW27HXR76D	essay1	From personal experiences as I have matured into an adult, I've noticed my thinking ability has grown more sophisiticated and robust.  It has grown specific in areas where I was meticulously involved in working closely with things.  This ranged from cooking to programming.  Technology like the microwave and prepackaged foods, which I relied on earlier in life allowed me to bypass thinking about cooking.  Easy to use computer interfaces also allowed me to bypass good thinking skills when it came to computer processes.  It wasn't until I deeply involved myself in the rudimentary processes of these activities did I develop better reasoning and knowledge about related things.  These experiences support issue 1 but I also thing that technology gives people more time to think about other things, which civilization is based on.
A1MJFW27HXR76D	essay2	There are perhaps societies which there very metropolitan and their defining characteristics come from their cities.  Conversely there are societies which their defining characteristics aren't core to their cities.  I would have to disagree more or less with the statement made my issue 2, but there certainly examples that support it.  Perhaps ancient Greece are good examples in support of Issue 2 as the most distinct characteristics of Greece come from Sparta and Athens.  On the otherhand, looking at American society in its past, you can see important characterisitics that have largely to do with the country side.  Cowboys, the gold rush, its nat
A1MJFW27HXR76D	essay3	Scandals do have the ability to generate outrage, and a cause to action among the populace to generate much need change as all levels of society.  Examples of this include: the watergate incident which served as fuel and motivation to make changes at the government accountability as high as the presidency.  Unfortunately I disagree that they focus attention on the core more important aspect of problems.  Witch hunts are a thing where people get lynched for fictitious reasons.  This is from bad information dissemination, and the unknowledgable public getting incited by a scandal they know little about.
A1N4P4XGQM7NXE	essay1	I do NOT believe this. Humans have shown time and time and time throughout history that working together and thinking for themselves. There are and have always been people who challenge the status quo and do things against the grain. If not working actively against technology, there will be people who can harness technology to make better things for themselves and others. And for the record, how can we quantitatively measure this anyway?
A1N4P4XGQM7NXE	essay2	I'm not qualified to answer this, am I? I suppose you can learn a ton about a society about what it holds dear by how it presents its cities. I mean, if you look at las vegas, you would see an ideal portrayed that is totally unrealistic. Streets are large, buildings are massive and overblown, and everything is glimmering and hopeful. The advertisements scream hedonic and indulgance. I was just there, so maybe im a little bias, but yes, the way cities are portrayed can definitely bias the way you think about a society.
A1N4P4XGQM7NXE	essay3	Scandal is a dirty word. What is a scandal? Public outcry? The public and media can make scandas
A1NM9PXZDCCQ1E	essay1	"The proliferation of technology and its impact on human intelligence is already evident to anyone who has spent more than five minutes on an online forum. Just two decades ago, the Internet promised us all the world's knowledge literally at our fingertips. Now, we communicate in little more than grunts and cave paintings in the form of memes, and many can barely form coherent sentences (e.g. ""your an idiot""). So fears that technology may actually impede or, worse, adversely affect human intelligence are not at all unreasonable. Algorithms are already able to feed us personalized news feeds on social networking sites, which further remove critical thought and solidify our firmly-planted positions in echo chambers of our own thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Technology and automation have freed us to spend more time than ever in intellectual pursuits, however many people choose instead to withdraw into mindless activities."
A1NM9PXZDCCQ1E	essay2	Major cities show us the very best of engineering, architecture, and sometimes history. In them, we find centers of politics, science, education, and finance. It makes sense then that we could look to major cities for clues about a society -- this holds true even in archeology, such as that of ancient Egypt. Just as then, modern major cities give us a glimpse at the inner workings of a society, from the most wealthy to the most destitute. Cities, being social centers of societies, show us who those people are or were, what they did, what they spent their money on, where they spent time. Cities capture a vivid picture of a given society, one citizen at a time.
A1NM9PXZDCCQ1E	essay3	Scandals actually detract from important issues. While scandals have some importance themselves in revealing corruption, immorality, dishonesty and the like, they also take away from the truly important things going on. Especially in our modern-day 24/7 news cycle, the salacious gets far more airtime than the critical. Unfortunately many scandals, while initially outrageous, go on to putter out, with no real change having occurred -- take for example the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal involving Facebook data. Does anyone really believe Facebook will change? Is our data any safer because Mark Zuckerberg went before Congress for an afternoon to get grilled? Of course not, one would have to be naive to believe that. The better tactic is for whistleblowers and watchdogs to platform for real change, informing on issues and giving people opportunities to understand and impact these problems.
A1NPQNVXPWACT7	essay1	With the evolution and advancement of technology, people have gained less in what to think and act before situations that are presented to us every day, we tend to consider situations such as making a simple breakfast or heating a ballera with water, that is, every day that passes we do not become more dependent on it and we persevere with the desire to do things for ourselves.
A1NPQNVXPWACT7	essay2	To establish communication with people of different nationalities you must first know the culture and different customs of a city, country, or continent. To get to understand each of these customs and get to have a wider communication, society and its characteristics are as a system of uses and procedures, of authority and mutual help, of many groupings and divisions, of human behavior controls and of freedoms.
A1NPQNVXPWACT7	essay3	In my personal opinion, I say that the problems if they focus our attention completely, depending on their severity, since people react more quickly to them when they see that these affect them directly.
A1O37EXDX935WH	essay1	As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate. Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.  In the era of advanced technology, technology has undoubtedly changed the way people live. With the use of calculators, people gradually get rid of mental arithmetic. Due to this fact, some people argue that the ability of humans to think for themselves will undoubtedly decline. This is because when relying excessively on instruments, people may hardly figure out the right number without calculators if the calculation becomes somewhat complicated.  Admittedly, it is true that human’s ability of calculation might diminish to some extent. However, technology decidedly facilitates humans to think deeply for themselves through freeing them from trivial things. This is an indisputable fact that with versatile and state-of-the-art computers, especially mainframe, scientists no longer take pains to deal with complex and numerous formulas. Therefore, these talented scientists can spend their time and energy in doing more meaningful things by avoiding being bogged down with trivial computations. For instance, engineers who major in aerodynamics, can use the latest computers to simulate how the attitude of airplane will change with respect to different levels of wind. Thus, due to the assistance of modern instruments, these engineers can focus more on how to design planes to fly more safely and efficiently.
A1O37EXDX935WH	essay2	Today, I will take apart a prompt from the Issue task. That is I’ll brainstorm, coming up with pros and cons and specific examples to back up each side.  I’ve taken an example from the ETS website. If you don’t know already, their website offers hundreds of sample essay prompts. Now if you’re not convinced and think, “Hey, I already have a book with sample essay prompts,” then consider this: test day the prompt you get will be one of the prompts on this site. It may very well be the following prompt:  To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.  Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.
A1O37EXDX935WH	essay3	Scandals have been a part of almost every field. They involve shocking, immoral or illegal behavior of people which is not approved of in the society. Because of their immoral nature they raise different extreme feelings and reactions amongst people. A scandal is therefore a problem generated in the society which becomes a concern and issue for a larger section of the society.   It is correct that we learn by making mistakes. It is only with experience of dealing with difficult situations that a person becomes wiser and practical. The problem forces you to try all the possible solutions and you come up with a permanent and lasting solution. Therefore, there is increased number of chances of not repeating it again. This type of learning that comes by actually committing mistakes lasts longer and you will never forget it. However, if you prepare for a problem that you might face in future, you are not going to pay as much attention to it as you pay to the existing problem.
A1OPSHV7LWGBUY	essay1	Technology is necessary in our daily lives and it has had many positive effects. However, it also has negative effects. People rely too much on technology for human contact such as online interactions with people on Facebook or texting. At the same time our ability and need for face to face contact has deteriorated. Young people in particular are vulnerable to this and can rely too much on technology in other aspects such as learning or thinking. Nowadays there is a lot of information available online and people don't have to particularly think for themselves or come to their own conclusions as they're being fed the abundance of information available via technology.
A1OPSHV7LWGBUY	essay2	Societies around the world are complicated and full of variety. Major cities are especially good sources of societies and can provide a lot of information on those societies. Most important characteristics of a society such as its customs and way of life can be seen in major cities where there is a high concentration of different people. This provides a lot of opportunity to study and learn about societies, as well as different ranks in those societies. For example, income and status differences in a society is highly visible in major cities and can tell us a lot about the people that make up a society.
A1OPSHV7LWGBUY	essay3	Scandals can be important because they can bring our attention to major issues. For example, recent sexual misconduct scandals have been able to reach a lot of people around the world and have been able to bring about awareness about the issue and also fuel change. Scandals offer a view into the issue from a point of view of the victims. While being negative, scandals can be more important than just public speaking about an issue because they get a lot more media attention and that in turn makes people more likely to become interested in the issues discussed. Scandals are thus a griping force that can channel change
A1P0XSCJ9XAV74	essay1	I believe this statement is true because technology is become so vast we don't need to do anything ourselves anymore. We can have our grocery's delivered to our house instead of going out into the real world and communicating with people. If we need to make a decision, there is an app that will help make it for you. Every day we rely on technology to get us through the day, and without it we don't seem to know what to do with ourselves. We need it and it is apart of us. Sometimes we cannot function without that cell phone in our hand. Some of our lives are dependent on that phone, it has our schedule, a list, contacts, without it we might fail. We can't rely on paper and pen anymore, we need an assistant, something we can talk too to get the job done for us. This helps shape my position because I don't think humans will be able to function without the use of technology anymore. It is an essential part of human life now, and almost anything can be solved, fixed, made better with it today.
A1P0XSCJ9XAV74	essay2	I don't agree with this statement because a society is not based upon major cities. To really get a handle on what society is like you need to explore the outer edges of the city. There are people that make up the society that don't live in the city. If you are fortunate to live in the city that means you must have some money. To get down to the nitty gritty, to really experience it, you have to see how people live outside of the city. That city doesn't make up for everyone that exists in the society. You would only have a minor glimpse of what life is like. There are poor people, middle class people, those that work with their hands, they get dirty, they help society, but you won't find them in the major cities. They are in the small towns, small cities that some people probably haven't even heard of. By focusing on the major cities, one might end up with stereotyped behavior. Things that are most common in the city, but not common other places. You have to look at the whole rather than just the parts, otherwise you will never understand why things are the way that they are.
A1P0XSCJ9XAV74	essay3	I agree with this statement and that scandals bring to light problems in an over the top way that we wouldn't have thought about them. When a scandal happens you are entranced, you are eager to know more about what is going on. It is presented to you in a story like fashion, making you glued to your seat to find out how it ends. No speaker or reformer could ever capture someone's attention that way because they lack the drama. They do not have what it takes to keep an audience hooked that long. Of course, on the other hand, if it was a celebrity or someone equally famous, they could probably focus our attention for a long time. It all depends on the delivery. If a speaker or reformer wanted to grab the audience, they could. All they need to do is use words that the audience wants to hear, speak in a way that is not too loud or soft, and engage them. A scandal is different, entriguing, but I think if a speaker wanted too, they could do the very same, by just being one with their audience.
A1PF01FF85HUY4	essay1	Technology doesn't make humans less able to think for themselves.  The idea that they use technology to make their lives easier doesn't detract from the idea that they have to now how to use it for an end that they want in the first place.  A person who doesn't know how to add or subtract has no use for or understand how a calculator would work.  The critical amount of information we receive via technology is available at an unprecedented pace, however that information is useless if we have no discernible use for it.
A1PF01FF85HUY4	essay2	The characteristics of a society are based on what you first perceive that society to be. Is a society a neighborhood, a town, a country.  There is truth to the idea to really grasp the characteristics of a society you must immerse yourself in it, however society is not limited to simply one geographical area or subset of people.  American society is vastly different in Texas when compared to New York.
A1PF01FF85HUY4	essay3	"Scandals are very useful as a deterrent from focusing on the happenings of everyday life or other things someone may not want you to focus on.  They have the ability to distract and engage an audience away from what the usual focus is on.  There is a reason for the well known saying ""stranger than fiction"".  It is also a part of the cruelest side of human nature to want to see other fail spectacularly."
A1PMZUBGXFANCI	essay1	"People have slowly moving towards this ever since the industrial age with automation. This is a very fast leap though and we should address this. People should change the way they think about things like this and ""exercise"" their brains. this could come in many forms and ways, like games or puzzles. technology has always defined what we focus on as far as what we put forth our cognitive effort into and this is no different. If we do not do something like this that is when we will fall into ruin, a world where technology surpasses us."
A1PMZUBGXFANCI	essay2	"A good majority of society is found in urban areas, and it's also a very diverse and compacted example. If you're looking into how government or economics function this is a perfect place to go. If you're interested in the day to day interaction between people this is also a good place to go for the good and the bad. if you compare it to rural settings yes you might have a very loose knit community but you can never understand ""Society"" without heavy daily interaction with many people. If you compare it to a smaller city is just doesn't grab all the factors that you could study from a main city like a capital."
A1PMZUBGXFANCI	essay3	Bringing problems to people when they can't see an example is hard for people to understand and believe. when a scandal breaks it brings about a wave of concern from most people that might or might not have trusted someone concerned about the topic before. This applies not just to scandals but also to most forms of information, it's the way the human brain works. If the person doesn't feel that the issue is relevant to their own life they tend to feel a lack of concern, even if they are told that it will be a huge issue in the future. It's just basic risk assessment and it varies from person to person.
A1QF14CNDAGL6X	essay1	     Yes I agree to this.People depends on the technologies,new gadgets to solve all their problem in life.people forgot to think in their own way,and forgot to find solutions for own problem.All became so dependent on technologies.Its very bad for future.people have  to use their own ability and believe in their self.Its not good for society.
A1QF14CNDAGL6X	essay2	Well major cities have experience of prons and cons.To understand how society is to learn to stay in major city.Its very important for every person.Have to understand each and every person how society is,how world is.From that people can learn different different things,different cultures everything,Can also learn how to behave in society everything.Its the most important thing in the life.
A1QF14CNDAGL6X	essay3	Yes as we take in positive way,scandals are good solve a problems,people wake up from that.and have to think about it in a good manner.we have to take everything in a positive way so that everything become good and positive.so that we can focus on that and give more attention.I agree to this.
A1QGG767E07WBA	essay1	I am a mother of 3 young children.  Growing up, we relied much on our own ability to overcome obstacles.  Such as; using a pen and paper to figure out a mathematical equation or figuring out how to cook a meal.  Observing how my children are being raised in an era of technological dependence, they are quick to ask google assistant for help or asking me to google it on the computer.  They are all answers at their finger tips, and we as adults are raising them to think this way.  We are raising them to become dependent on our devices and not our own knowledge or skills.  The more we become dependent on these electronics, the human ability of t
A1QGG767E07WBA	essay2	Humans are very social creatures.  We love to gather in communities and thrive together.  To understand different cultures or societies, one must look at the major cities.  The most populated areas will tell you most about the specifics of a society.  Since most humans learn and adapt skills from one from one another.  We mostly tend to want to form a social norm amongst ourselves.  You will find is some largely populated areas that they are generally follow a certain religion or faith.  You will also find the strengths and struggles or
A1QGG767E07WBA	essay3	People are interested in things that peak their curiosity.  Topics that are unfamiliar to them or could be a situation that in daring.  As human beings, we get a thrill out of seeing lives played out through different scenarios.  We enjoy attention grabbing situations to hear other peoples perspectives on what they would do or their thoughts.  It helps open our way of thinking and reasoning.  It helps us explore situations we may not have imagined exploring and helping us grow as people.  Listening to a speaker or reformer, their speaches
A1QLOUFT5A0GO2	essay1	I agree with the premise that the ability of humans to think for themselves will suffer with the use of technology. I have noticed with my own children that as they have been allowed to use calculators in school, they have lost the ability to perform calculations for themselves. Cashiers in retail establishments are another such example--they cannot calculate change for themselves, but must rely on the cash register to calculate it for them. At the same time, I recognize that technological devices can serve to extend one's memory capacity and not require a person to remember so much.
A1QLOUFT5A0GO2	essay2	I think much can be learned about a society by studying its major cities. Cities are economic and social engines, focusing their infrastructure and activities on growth. These may serve as indicators of a society's values. This is why terrorists sometimes select important structures or buildings in a city to target, because they represent the values of each city's residents. For example, the 9/11 terrorists selected the World Trade towers and the Pentagon, each of which represent important characteristics of  American society--economic and military power.
A1QLOUFT5A0GO2	essay3	I do not feel that scandals are generally useful. While they do focus the attention of the public, the attention they attract does not advance the solution of issues. For example, the Stormy Daniels scandal is certainly interesting for its salaciousness, but attention to the issue does not solve any of the important issues of the day.
A1RATFICCKLCQ	essay1	Technology is constantly evolving and in so doing, it consumes us all the more. No matter what your feelings about technology are, we can all agree that it would be hard to live without it. Increasingly, it has become the go to solution to solve our problems. Reliance on technology does not impair our ability to think because like any extremely valuable resource, technology continues to inspire us as a force of change.  Whether it is giving us directions, doing our banking, or helping to educate us, technology has driven innovation and creativity. Instead of restricting us, It frees us from dealing with old, mundane problems and makes them obsolete. We can use the time we have gained to tackle more complex problems that require creativity, comprehensive, and imaginative solutions. This allows us to make the next leap forward as we, human beings evolve alongside technology.
A1RATFICCKLCQ	essay2	It is true that to understand the important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities. This is a necessity if one wants to know the values, needs, and wants of a society. Major cities are a smaller reflection of society. They reflects the behaviors, the decisions, the culture, and the thinking of the people who created these cities. By studying the constructs they built, the businesses they run, and their ways of living in the major cities, we gain a deeper appreciation of what is important to the people living in that society. For example, we can see how the society valued its citizens by looking at the infrastructure and how much resources of the city was allocated to helping the impoverished vs the well to do people.
A1RATFICCKLCQ	essay3	Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could. They are hot topics which attract a lot of publicity.  Media covers the scandals and people are clued in and start discussing these scandals in ways they would normally not pay attention to when it involves more mundane issues. Scandals often set benchmarks and may follow a legal course that brings to light judgments which aid in the creation of a better and more just society. Scandals are powerful tools that can pave the way for requisite reform within the system. For example, the Watergate scandal led to Nixon's registration and brought legal action against the abuse of power in the Nixon's administration. News anchors, government officials, business people and the public all help to communicate, condemn or promote these scandals.
A1SLM4JRDIM430	essay1	"People rely on technology now more than ever to solve problems for them, and I personally agree that it is affecting the ability of humans to think for themselves. These days, even a simple math problem cannot be solved without someone grabbing their smart phone to use their calculator. People are making judgment calls about what is safe, or popular dependent on what they can learn via the internet. Everywhere you turn there is a smart phone, a laptop, or even greater technology for someone to use. Common sense has seemed to vanish in recent years. Even companies are relying heavily on algorithms to make decisions that normally a CEO or team of peers would group together and research to make. They are even coming out with ""smart cars"" to drive themselves instead of depending on actual human intelligence and skill to move from one place to another. The modern day use of technology is increasingly diminishing needs for human interactions, and it scares me deeply as to what will become of our future."
A1SLM4JRDIM430	essay2	I do not agree with the statement that the most important characteristics of a study can be understood by studying it's major cities. A city is simply that, a city. One are, one place that distinguishes itself from the next. Each environment you enter can be surrounded by different beliefs, religions, ethics, and morals. Values vary greatly from person to person, neighborhoods, and atmospheres, so to base an understanding on a society solely based on it's most populated areas would be absurd. The most important characteristics of a society lie within it's people. Their beliefs, their values, and how they treat one another. People, human beings, are what make up a society. Most major cities are booming industrial wise, but industries reveal nothing about a person's individuality. A lot of people work simply because they need the money. To find the most important characteristics of a society you need to study that specific societies inhabitants. Find what they have in common, what pulls them together, and what makes their community unique.
A1SLM4JRDIM430	essay3	I do not believe scandals are useful by focusing our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could. I do not believe scandals are useful at all. Scandals do nothing but create more division, hate, and distrust in an already troubled world. Scandals are used to draw more media attention, when instead the media should focus more on what is positive in the world. It is in my honest opinion that no one person that walks this Earth is perfect. We are all human, and we all make errors. If we as humans reminded ourselves of that, and brought to light more positives about one another, I believe there would be much less hate in the world. Scandals bring a sense of sadness, anger, and resentment. They place blame, always, and usually the media makes it worse than what it truly is. If we could focus more on the fact that we learn from our mistakes, and that there is much more to be positive about in the world, I believe we would pull together more and create a sense of u
A1SO9QOKYVLZZM	essay1	I agree with the statement. We already see the effect of smartphone usage in our society in the form of texting and driving. Users cannot be separated from their device, even while performing a life-or-death task, in which their lack of attention can be deadly to many people. As companies like Facebook have publicly stated, they optimize their platform in order to keep people addicted to their website, and this is having drastic consequences in everyday life.
A1SO9QOKYVLZZM	essay2	The statement is very true in our society. The issues of great importance in politics are almost always directed at large cities. Rural citizens may not ever come upon a scenario in which they are conflicted on racial issues, but urban settings see this problem constantly. To have a deep grasp of the issues that trouble us, people must investigate the problems for themselves, especially in our major cities.
A1SO9QOKYVLZZM	essay3	I disagree with the statement. Scandals are often fabricated in order in order to gain public disfavor with public officials. This can be often seen during political elections, most often for the election of a President. During the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, during the democratic primary, Former President Obama was allegedly caught in a scandal where he was pictured wearing Muslim religious attire. The event was rumored to be fabricated by the Hillary Clinton campaign, and was swiftly erased after the primary election concluded, beginning the general election. The general election was silent on this allegation, lending credibility to the rumor that the photograph was falsified.
A1SX9DT3XHX845	essay1	While technological advancements have allowed humanity to progress to a point of space travel, the population continues to suffer in complacency. With each new addition to consumer technology we become more reliant on these devices rather than analytically solving our problems. This has been more noticeable in recent years, specifically since the wide-spread acceptance of smart devices, that have taken over daily tasks for us. This becomes further complicated as many of these devices are now ordering stuff for us and controlling more of our finances on a daily basis, in many cases children growing into adulthood cannot balance a checkbook without the use of technology. Every fascist of  society has been marred and we need to be the ones to take back control, we need to be teaching our children how to function without the use of such devices so they can truly understand and appreciate the simplicity that technology affords us without sacrificing their analytical abilities.
A1SX9DT3XHX845	essay2	While major cities do play a role in our civilization, I personally not believe that one could reach a full understanding of the important characteristics of society solely through these locations. Society is vast and spread out, with each taking on their own ideals based on their surroundings for instance, in cities people are reliant on food from grocery stores while farmers in the mid-west are dependent on their yearly crops. Major cities have a tendency to develop their own internal characteristics that would only be found in cities due to the environment these individuals are living in, this has caused a kind of cultural blend to occur and is not entirely indicative of societal standing because of the specificity of the environment. Rather than looking at major cities solely to gain and understanding of the important characteristics of society, one must look at a broad range of locations to gain a better understanding of how each civilization operates.
A1SX9DT3XHX845	essay3	Scandals in recent years have taken our focus away from important issues and problems and should have never occurred in the first place. In many ways scandals are becoming common place however, I personally believe this is merely a distraction to take public interest from one area to the next. For instance the FCC recently overturned net neutrality laws that were in place to protect common interest and promote growth of the marketplace however, in recent months after the vote to overturn these laws many scandals have arisen that coincidentally have distracted public interest away from the FCC and placed them solely on each of these scandals. I believe that it is corruption in it's purest form and each of these events have only allowed each of these crooks to continue to operate under the guise of decency and what is in the public's best interest.
A1T3ROSW2LC4FG	essay1	In general as you fail to practice a skill that skill will be lost. For instance and doing mTurk tasks I've learned to focus very tightly for a set period of time.  After several years of doing hits I notice that I have difficulty in focusing for longer periods of time.  It seems that the more we practice the skill, the better we get at it and the more efficient we become. The less we practice a skill the more that ability is lost. I would imagine as with other uses of technology this would be this case.  for instance, the use of calculators. Many years ago people were able to do a great number of calculations within their head. Square roots and some more advanced calculations were able to be done as mental arithmetic  or by memorization. Those skills are no longer once we know or practice. I would imagine that the same will be true of developing technology. For this reason I believe that we will see an acceleration of lost skills as technology advances and they are no longer needed. Humans will think less, and interpret data more.
A1T3ROSW2LC4FG	essay2	I completely agree that we must study cities in order to understand societies and they're important characteristics.  Cities are merely a reflection of the society who designs and builds them. For example, cities do not appear on their own from nature. They are designed and built by members of society who seek form and function to support the needs of the citizens.  It is for this reason that it is very unlikely that buildings would be built without need, or at the very least desire. Form and function go hand-in-hand, and buildings are built for a purpose.  Just as buildings are built, cities are made up of smaller units of buildings. Cities reflect the needs and character of the buildings in them just as buildings reflect the needs of the society.
A1T3ROSW2LC4FG	essay3	Scandals are indeed useful for reforming and focusing attention on particular problems that need to be addressed within our society. This is particularly true because so much attention gets citizens involved and demanding change and reform. However the flip side is also true. When receiving large amounts of media  attention, an issue can be blown significantly out of proportion. This is in many ways a frightening reality when anyone in power can put out a news story that is false at worst, or significantly misrepresented at best. You need to consider whose voice you're listening to and what their agenda is when you determine what they wish to change from the current system and what the benefit of doing so to them is. Some one wins and someone loses.
A1T9KDKDFO114S	essay1	I do not bellieve this because we need the human brain to think of new tech ideas.  of, execute, produce and market new tech ideas. We then have the consumers who will learn and become proficient with the new tech. All is ever evolving and one discovery hinges on the next. How can brains atrophy in a society like that? I think our brain power will increase, no decrease due to this.  We will always have tasks that cannot be completed by AI. As timme goe on, the tasks become more complex but so does our understanding of our tech world. I cannot see humans ever being phased out or atrophied into
A1T9KDKDFO114S	essay2	I guess the premise is that to really understand humans we need to crowd a bunch together so that they have to use their  best manners. I do not believe this or I do not WANT to believe this because it is like saying that if you put 15 dogs in a really tight area, they have to learn to get along. SAme principle. We have learned more how to navigate society than dogs but I feel the premise holds true.  In cities you see a lot more different cultures, different businesses. People have to cooperate a lot more because of limited space. I.e., manners.  We have had to develop a whole lot of rules to regulate ourselves in tight quarters. Most people do pretty well in
A1T9KDKDFO114S	essay3	"Scandals are usually a result of someone taking umbrage at someone else bucking traditions. I believe that ir is time for a lot of our traditions to be broken down, reorganized, rewritten. I think we need some new ideas towards the conservative, ""it's always been this way"" attitude. We need those boat rockers, the radical thinkers and we need to listen. Today's scandals will be but a passing memory in 50 years, just like those of 50 years ago are a memory, amusing even. Scandal is based on the ""accepted"" norms and ""accepted"" is subjective and doesn't past the test of history (Thank you God!).  We will have new ones tomorrow. Interesting!"
A1TM5TYL7AI19V	essay1	The ability for humans, think for themselves will continue to deteriorate as time goes on.  This is supported by the fact that individuals are interacting with technology at a young age.  This was not always the case, but the Millenials and Generation X are mostly totally involved in technology.  For example, in school teachers do not use any form of paperwork at my local high school.  Everything is done on the computer, and on Ipads.  This isn't a bad option, but it eliminates the human factor in working on assignments and using your own brain to correct grammar and spelling.  Most computers will automatically correct any grammar or spelling errors, which does not help kids at all.  This teaches them to rely on technology, instead of using their own brain their own knowledge of such skills.
A1TM5TYL7AI19V	essay2	For a society to understand the most important characteristics that it has to offer, we have to study major and small cities.  Its imporatant that as we look upon these cities that we make sure to take the time to look at all aspects of our society.  There is not a correct answer when it comes to picking one city, or one size of a community to observe,  For example, there seems to be more personalized compassion for our fellow humans when we observe a small community, as most individual as knowing each other.  This is not to say that people who live in a large city do not have any of this compassion, but it is harder to observe and it is harder to know everyone in a city that has over 10,000 unique indivuals.  In conclusion, we need to make sure we observe all of society, not just one size of certain cities.
A1TM5TYL7AI19V	essay3	Scandals for the most part deal with certain areas that are kept secret for one reason or another.  When scandals come to light, it brings a lot of focus and attention to the subject at hand.  This is why scandals are important to all aspects of peoples lives.  For example, the scandal with Richard Nixon brought a lot of problems to light, that the average American would not have  known about.  It gives people a chance to do some research on their own and to see if the scandal is true or not.  Of course, there can be some bad examples of scandals, but that comes with the territory.  In conclusion, its important to remember that scandals are brought to light to make the issues known and to work out certain situations, in ways that speakers or reformers never had the chance to do so.
A1TO8F0HIM1OBQ	essay1	I do not think that the the issue outlined above is so black and white. Obviously new technology has had a profound impact on the human race and has become integral to modern life, so it stands to reason that it will shape the way that humans evolve going forward. However, I think it is an oversimplification to assume that it will cause human intelligence and critical thinking skills to deteriorate. It seems more likely that the human mind will adapt to technology, and evolve in a way that allows for different forms or modes of thinking. Whether or not these new modes are seen as a deterioration from previous modes will probably be subjective. I do think that technology will cause people to rely on it more for practical things (such as self-driving cars or apps that help manage a diet), but I see no reason why this would cause humans to stop thinking for themselves. If anything, it will free people from worrying about basic things that often distract us, and allow us to think more abstractly. I am of the opinion that technology can only improve the way we think, though it may make us slightly lazier in the process.
A1TO8F0HIM1OBQ	essay2	To limit the most important characteristics of society to cities seems to oversimplify culture to highly specific regions and practices. While it is true that cities have dense populations and are often viewed as the heart of any given culture, this does not meant that they embody all (or even most) of a given societies cultural characteristics. Large populations outside of cities have their own practices, customs, beliefs, and general way of life. To exclude these as being somehow lesser is to misunderstand what a society represents. Society is a whole. While it does have individual parts that can be categorized, and some parts seem to have a greater impact on the whole than others, this does not mean that any one part should be held above the others in importance, as they all contribute to the whole. Moreover, the city and the country often have a symbiotic relationship that should not be ignored.
A1TO8F0HIM1OBQ	essay3	While this is probably a controversial opinion, it is not without merit. Often times, people repress how they really feel or choose not to think about or discuss an issue because it makes them uncomfortable. Many problems that sex workers face are not addressed simply because many people disagree with the occupation from a moral standpoint, or simply because they deem the subject inappropriate. Scandals allow us to face problems that would otherwise never (or at least rarely) be discussed. If a politician is caught pressuring a woman with less power to have sex with them, this issue allows us to address power dynamics between men and women, as well as the culture of toxic masculinity that is both complex and uncomfortable to address. Scandals force us to look at issues that, on any other day, we would probably ignore. Without them, the wheels of progress would surely turn much more slowly.
A1TTFE7OTLIJW8	essay1	There's definitely a fairly strong support for this statement in this day and age.  There's a lot of evidence that children who do a lot of math with computer programs and calculators lose the ability to do problems without them.  They lose some critical thinking skills by focusing on only using a device to do problems with.  This is just one concrete example of this, as it's often hard to see these effects in fields with less concrete answers.  However, it is entirely possible to counter these effects with a focused effort, making people do things without access to this technology at a young age can keep their brains sharp for when they need it.
A1TTFE7OTLIJW8	essay2	Cities are a major part of any society.  The majority of successful, connected people congregate in cities.  This causes it to be easier to form relationships and exchanges of goods and information, meaning that societies tend to grow from cities outward.  This isn't to say that outlying areas aren't also important, but the people in power tend to shape society, and since they're mostly in cities you can see the society by looking at the cities.  America is a strange counterpoint to this, as due to the size and variety of the country, there are a lot of aspects of American culture that come from the rural parts of the country.
A1TTFE7OTLIJW8	essay3	Scandals do tend to shed light on the bad parts of a group or society.  Without seeing some of these scandals, the negative parts of the group might hide away for a long time, causing trouble behind the scenes in ways that you can't counter.  You could assume everything is going well, but in reality something is happening behind the scenes that is negatively effecting everyone else.  When just speaking about a group, if you bring to light some negative aspect, it could just be swept under the rug or ignored by the people that can do anything about it.
A1U8HCXVACOGJ8	essay1	When problem solving is left to technological devices, thinking skills are not exercised and, like an unused muscle, will become weak. In the absence of technology, people will not be able to careful reason their way through steps to solve problems if they don't practice critical thinking skills. Propaganda will rise as people look to social media to form their opinions. Inventive solutions will decrease along with productivity. A balance must be struck to prevent the loss of skills to technology depependence
A1U8HCXVACOGJ8	essay2	Cities give the unique opportunity to learn about society due to the multiple types of people and cultures present in most cities. One can observe people from the most affluent to the most poverty-stricken. Opportunities to observe arts of all types give more insights into a society. Even the architecture can give an observer insights and clues into how the society has been shaped over time. Due to the vast numbers of people and their contributions over time, cities provide a rich opportunity to learn about a society more than rural areas of the same country.
A1U8HCXVACOGJ8	essay3	Because scandals usually involve salacious details and invite judgement, problems brought to light by scandals are often given more attention and weight than other problems that lack titillating details. Scandals also invite others to jump in and say, yes that happened to me too and in some way face less judgement. Scandals also stay in the public eye longer due to media milking the details for ratings. Sometimes scandals can bring about change much faster than a reformer ever could but the results may not be as complete and positive as reform could be. Scandals are often overblown by media too but serve a
A1V2H0UF94ATWY	essay1	I disagree that reliance on technology is detrimental to human's ability to think for themselves. Life is still becoming increasingly complex; it is just that we hardly notice it because technology enables us to process more information and accomplish more on a daily basis. The better a person is at utilizing technology, the faster and more effortlessly they can multi-task which, in turn, increases that person's ability to reason and solve problems.
A1V2H0UF94ATWY	essay2	Major cities develop from the needs and prosperity of a society and are indeed reflective of its characteristics. A city like San Diego relies on its port and International border for its economic growth that is fueled by both military presence and trade. Sacramento was built on the wealth created by gold and railroads and, indeed, has productive mines that operate to this day. it is also the junction for the state's major railroad. A city like Boise, the state capital of Idaho, was originally a commercial center for the miners in the surrounding mountains but now attracts high tech industries through its extensive infrastructure. Study the cities and their growth patterns and you will gain insight to the
A1V2H0UF94ATWY	essay3	Most scandals direct attention away from what is important and serve as a distraction to progress. Many scandals are overblown as the public seems to have an insatiable need to tear down others that are merely trying to make the same moral decisions we all face on a daily basis. Much of the time, behavior that is described as scandalous, is not; more often it is just a mistake made by someone who has not fully developed his or her character. We see this often in young people who have fame and fortune thrust upon them before they are fully mature and ready to act in a way that the public would see as completely moral or trustworthy.
A1VC6F0FYG1L5I	essay1	I think this is only partially true because people will get better at utilizing technology but maybe not think of how to solve the problem themselves.  People are getting better using technology and making it where it solves a lot of our problems and this will only continue in the future.  People are becoming very adept at using computers and such but not so much thinking of ideas on their own.  If people make computers smarter and better at solving problems we don't necessarily have to think of solving problems without technology.  Computers and technology make our lives easier and this only going to increase in the years and make it where we don't just have to rely on our brain alone.
A1VC6F0FYG1L5I	essay2	I think this is false because cities and rural areas can have very different characteristics.  Rural areas may say certain characteristics are ideal while a city may look down on those same characteristic.  City living and country living is very different things and a lot of people either stick with one or the other so if someone is just studying the cities they may be missing out on a very big group that is different.  Rural areas are seen as more slow than cities but that means big differences in how people live which is something that must be looked at as well.  Cities move faster and may characteristics that are considered rude to rural people but it is normal in cities.  There are tons of examples of how that statement is false.
A1VC6F0FYG1L5I	essay3	I do believe that this statement is correct because scandals make a particular problem known and in our face immediately.  A good example is the Harvey Winestein scandal and how that got the United States talking about women issues and how power comes into play.  If that scandal had not happened everything could have still been swept under the rug.  Speakers and reformers can talk till they are blue in the face but until it is a national headline most people don't care.  People have short attention spans and news happens in minutes it seems like so it has to be something scandalous to hold our attention nowadays.    People will have their phones set to only beef if something big is happening which is another reason scandals are useful in focusing our attention on problems.
A1VIP6S8H2XXH7	essay1	I disagree with the perception that the advancements in technology will lead to the deterioration of the ability for humans to think. I believe if anything, the advancements in technology further the ability of humans to think. While machines are able to analyze vastly larger sets of data in a far more efficient than that of the human mind, the ability for the human mind to apply the analysis to real world events will never be overcome. For example, recent trends in genome mapping through the usage of complex AI engines like IBM Watson have provided researchers the ability to relatively quickly use genome mapping from millions of individuals and slice the data by different filters. From there, researchers are able to use the data to advance the human understanding of the origin of disease and affliction. This is one of many examples where advancements in technology do not only prevent the deterioration of the contribution of the human mind, but to me it only enhances the capacity and capability of the human mind to further the evolution and understanding of man as a whole.
A1VIP6S8H2XXH7	essay2	I agree with the interpretation that major cities are society’s most important. I believe it is clearly illustrated through a quick analysis at the origins of the majority of innovation. Traditionally, innovators and intelligent individuals seek out education to further their knowledge before using their education and intelligence to change the narrative of society as we know it. While not all institutions reside in major cities, a majority of high achieving graduates actively seek to transform their ability to succeed in major metropolitan hubs like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, or the Bay Area. I believe that in leveraging understanding of successful businesses that not only are profitable, but those that actively change the paradigm of our lives as we know it reside within the confines of a major city. It is for this reason that I believe that major cities are society’s most important.
A1VIP6S8H2XXH7	essay3	I disagree that scandals are useful in focusing our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could. A scandal, by definition, holds a negative connotation and implies a negative event or experience. I below that the ability to articulate a clear problem in an intelligent and capable manner goes far further in enabling society to address and overcome issues. Looking at history, the key individuals in the alterations of events like the Civil War (Abraham Lincoln) and Civil Rights Movement (MLK and Malcolm X) did not partake in any sort of scandal in order to further their agenda and illustrate key deficiencies in the functioning of society as a whole. They relied on their intellect and ability to unite people for a common cause to rally against their perceived inequalities, and used this unification to alter the course of history. For this reason, I believe that scandals are not useful in focusing our attention on problems in ways no speaker or reformer ever could, a truly intelligent and charismatic individual will always be able to identify and help solve societal issues.
A1VPSUPBTA6Q87	essay1	The people make solve any problem is confident to clear. But once upon time the people can destroy their mind solve question because can understand problem. The every day life change problem at moderate. The technology to solve problem is important but one think how to solve problem. the human ability surely complete technical problem. I think is not easy solve problem.
A1VPSUPBTA6Q87	essay2	The most important society is must major city. The people can take overall confident finish any problem, but there is not a good way. The human can change mind. the critical area is not complete life study. The human life dangerous of all areas but major for one city. the society is important for the character because the character life goal, day to day life change everything but cannot change character.
A1VPSUPBTA6Q87	essay3	The human life is most important factor is Scandal because the people take over charge is scandal. The politician and government is important for the scandal. The focus is attention but there is no speaker or reformer ever could. The main important is scandal stage, it can any cash department, society and more people advantage.
A1WGAGT5ZN4A3X	essay1	Depending on technology is a convenience for sure, because there are many things that can be done in a snap. For example, in hospitals, dependence on technology saves lives. It's just that simple. A con of this dependence, however, is that we as humans are less likely to be inventive at the basic level. We will just resort to looking for an app, or device to resolve our inconveniences. This does not help the mind to grow. This can be overcome individually if we start to think backward; that is, find ways to be more creative and self-sufficient. This will be a huge challenge for sure.
A1WGAGT5ZN4A3X	essay2	Society is only as good as it's members. When we consider the major cities across the US, we will be inundated with crime, drugs, pollution, and overcrowding issues. Paying attention to these societal facts with no doubt lead you to a long list of current problems that have not been resolved. One thing is certain, no matter what major cities you examine, they all will share some of the same characteristics which can be compared to a table or chart. To study these characteristics is to understand them. To understand them is to what..? Hopefully, resolve them. Otherwise, why are we interested?
A1WGAGT5ZN4A3X	essay3	Scandals are a part of life for some of us. One we know of a scandal, it is up to us to either feed it or discard it. The problem is that when one's scandal is aired across media channels, the rest of us tend to be judgemental as if we don't have problems of our own. I think that individuals should reflect on their own problems more, and stop being hypocritical in judging others. None of us is without fault, and there is enough work to be done in our lives to keep us busy. Self-improvement is a lifetime chore to me. This is how one lives life to the fullest. Don't stop learning and improving as long as breath is with you.
A1WISFBL3J5Z12	essay1	I agree with this statement because it is a natural human tendency to take the easy way out. This means depending on others, be they human or machine to solve their problems. As technology becomes more and more ubiquitous, people began integrating daily habits without realizing that slowly they are losing tthe ability to perform them themselves.
A1WISFBL3J5Z12	essay2	Cities tend to be melting pots of society where people from all walks of life come together to live and work. As the demographics of are usually a natural smorgasbord of people from all walks of life, it is natural to expect that it would be a natural reflection of society.
A1WISFBL3J5Z12	essay3	I agree with this position because scandals draw our attention to problems that may not be as readily apparent. They have a tendency to focus the spotlight on not only the issues but also on minute details surrounding the issues.  When used properly, and not as a distraction, scandals can be a tool to address and fix severe problems.
A1XDMS0KFSF5JW	essay1	Technology gets farther into our lives every year.  People can be seen every day using smart phones to look up data to help them in their daily lives. On one hand this is great help, on the other hand, this convenience means that the users of this technology don't need to remember anything. we are now in an age were what others write on the internet mean that those so called others will be thinking for the consumers of data. An editor on wikipedia will have sway over what some one thinks.  For that matter, a horde of bots upvoting an unpopular opinion can currently make that opinion seem legitimate and believable.  People are no longer thinking for themselves and this will get worse.
A1XDMS0KFSF5JW	essay2	Everything revolves around cities. They are the choke point for civilization. What goes on in a  city is just a distillation of what goes on in society. What is being produced in the farm lands, is being consumed in the cities. If a city is dysfunctional, than it a person can make a leap that that dysfunction applies to the rest of a county. A city is more like a accelerated lab to figure out how the rest of a society functions.  Social interactions happen faster, and for that matter, everything happens faster.  Including the spread of disease and the adaptation of technology.
A1XDMS0KFSF5JW	essay3	Scandals might focus our attention, but they do so in unhealthy way. Scandals induce knee jerk reactions to what is in the news.  Knee jerk reactions mean that any justice that needs to be dealt out is unfortunately unfair (though usually swift). This is due to the need to make examples out of the parties the scandal centers around.  The result is result is mob justice; which means an injustice takes place. It is important for this issues to be made public, but they need to be made public responsibly.  People are also to quick to judge in a scandal,  and people don't reflect on how they are alike to the perpetrators of a scandal. Instead they will think of themselves as morally superior.
A1XP28Y55SEQPJ	essay1	yes some people surely deteriorate the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate
A1XP28Y55SEQPJ	essay2	The most important society is must major city. The people can take overall confident finish any problem, but there is not a good way. The human can change mind. the critical area is not complete life study. The human life dangerous of all areas but major for one city. the society is important for the character because the character life goal, day to day life change everything but cannot change character.
A1XP28Y55SEQPJ	essay3	The human life is most important factor is Scandal because the people take over charge is scandal. The politician and government is important for the scandal. The focus is attention but there is no speaker or reformer ever could. The main important is scandal stage, it can any cash department, society and more people advantage.
A1YBX7P5PY8LL	essay1	There are many different ways people can use technology today to help them think and make decisions.  This is good because it increases efficiency and provides people more time to focus on other tasks.  However, critical thinking and problem solving is an ability that takes time to perfect.  Thinking about possible solutions and opinions is often vital to find the best possible solution to fit different scenarios.  When one relies too much on technology, they are not training their brain to think critically.
A1YBX7P5PY8LL	essay2	Countries and especially regions are different in many ways, including ideologies, thoughts and opinions, and ways of life.  In order to find out the most important characteristics of a society, one must look at all different locations and groups of people.  Looking at a variety of cities and the way people live is important to gauge what the most important issues are because you can compile a variety of data points.  From there, you can find the ones that are similar and that provides a comprehensive outlook about a society.   Looking at only a few will only provide a small piece of the puzzle.
A1YBX7P5PY8LL	essay3	When scandals occur, it provides people with an idea of important aspects of society and what people value.  Scandals provide information about what motivates people to work and get ahead in society.  Often, reformers only look at major issues effecting a country or society, and fail to look a wide range of issues.  Also, often reformers might be biased or have a vested interested in one of these areas, and neglect to act for fear of affecting their own possible gain.  Studying scandals can help society really bring the major issues to the forefront, and get people talking about changes to decrease cheating.
A1YM0IWPC72J7V	essay1	It will not deteriorate because a human is always curious. Even if others do not rise to the challenge, a few will. And those are the people who will stand out and question everything. They will show that technology isn't the answer to everything but merely as a tool to help. If you can not think, then how can you even operate the technology itself. You need to have a capable mind, and it is proven within older generations and younger generations. As technology develop, younger generations can easily tune in, while older generations struggle. Yet if they even a small experience of technology within older generations, they can think about how to operate it.
A1YM0IWPC72J7V	essay2	I do not agree because this does not give a whole picture. Only limiting yourself to certain areas will not provide enough data for reliable answers. It's like painting a picture, or building a place. If you only work on small details, it doesn't really portray the whole result. Major cities doesn't only provide important details, but small towns, and rural places can show why it is still in this state. What kind of characteristics can these places also provide to show what a whole society really thinks.
A1YM0IWPC72J7V	essay3	I disagree because it rises attention to matters, but scandals should never happen in the first place. We as humans should look to better ourselves and learn not to cause trouble. We all live together on this world, yet people want to be greedy or cause problems. Scandals can only bring controversial talks that do not bring anyone into positive lights. It distracts people from the real important matters that affect everyone in the society.
A1ZTSCPETU3UJW	essay1	I agree with the idea that the dependency on technology is deteriorating the ability for humans to think for themselves.  People are too reliant on technology to think for them.  One example is the use of spellcheck. or the use of Grammarly. People have forgotten how to spell words correctly.  Another example is the use calculators.  People no longer need to know how to calculate problems.  Without calculators people do not remember how to do simple calculations after grade school.  These are a few example of the decline of society to due technology.
A1ZTSCPETU3UJW	essay2	I disagree that one must study major cities to understand the important characteristics of a society.  Studying a major city only teaches the characteristics of that particular city.  Those results and observations only pertain to that city and not all of society.  Understanding why people behave a certain way in a subway doesn't not relate to how people act on a Black Friday in a Walmart in a rural town in the midwest.  Studies of major cities may help determine characteristics of other major cities but it is not a blanket study on all facets of society.
A1ZTSCPETU3UJW	essay3	Scandals can focus our attention to a problem in a manner which no speaker or pundit could.  The Harvey Weinstein scandal is a good example of this.  For years, much of the entertainment business knew of Mr. Weinstein's disturbing behaviors but it was only hearsay.  Victims of his actions were not given a voice and if they did speak up it would be the end of their acting careers.  After enough people spoke up the scandal arose.and with that women who were objectified by Weinstein were able to show the common behaviors that occurred in the entertainment industry.  Scandals can bring focus to a si
A209JKJR9QN5S0	essay1	    People like to argue that technology is killing people ability to think for themselves, but I would like to propose that technology simply brings a different, more modern form of thought to the table.  As time evolves, so does the way we interact and process information.  In the modern day and age most of the jobs that people will be able to find deal with technology in some way shape or form.  I would in fact argue that turning your back on technology only deteriorates yours own thinking.  Just because a person sees an issue one way, that does not mean that an entire society as a whole will adopt those ideas.  Giving up on technology only hurts yourself in the longrun.
A209JKJR9QN5S0	essay2	When studying an areas society or culture it is very important to examine the large cities within that area.  This allows you to view and study a large amount of people together in a condensed area opening your to a wide variety of ideas and opinions.  When many people are together in one area they often can share a lot of share quirks or traditions.  Viewing these cities also allows you to see how the society survives economically.  Almost all cities are located in an area that allows them to take advantage of their surrounding natural resources.  If a city is on the coastline, it is likely that they will have busy ports importing and exporting goods at all times.
A209JKJR9QN5S0	essay3	Scandals often reveal things in a way that no individual speaker could ever convey.  They often show the deepest darkest sides of many interactions and can be the spark for movements that work for change.  Scandals can many of the time, address issues that a society is having that no one has spoken up about.  Although people may argue that these scandals can be harmful to the well being of a group of people,  the reason these scandals often happen is because of a nasty issue that has been plaguing  a community.
A20ALQT1HIVSAH	essay1	I believe that this thought has a lot of merit behind it. I grew up without technology and have seen it advance enough to where I feel as if I've seen enough to form a valid opinion on it. I see it with debates. People are very quick to go online and form their opinions based on other people's research and own opinions without even being able to back up their thoughts. People spread information without even fact checking to make sure it's accurate. The first response of many today is to go google an answer to see what others are saying before even taking 10min to sit and ruminate the subject for themselves to see what they may think on their own.
A20ALQT1HIVSAH	essay2	I can see why people might believe this, but I'm not so sure this really is true. Not many people live around major cities but they still are part of a society with characteristics built into it. Smaller areas can be so very different from the larger cities they may be hours away from. I can see why people might believe that there could be a trickle down effect, saying that the big city gives off certain aspects that branch out to the smaller ones but I have been part of smaller cities that are nothing like the major cities that are in their surrounding areas.
A20ALQT1HIVSAH	essay3	I believe that this could be true to the extent that it brings about debate over issues.  People talking is always better than people not talking at all. However, this can be harmful to those who the scandals are about so I believe it depends on what we are talking about. A politician who needs their baggage brought to light or a marriage splitting apart that causes people to speculate and causes great pain to the family who just needs privacy. So I can see both sides of this, though I tend to believe that drama is hurtful and causes more bad than good in many cases.
A20X14OMRL0YPZ	essay1	Humans are creative beings who thrive when challenged so it's easy to see why someone might that that technology will solve all our problems and leave humans unchallenged resulting in the deterioration of the ability to think for themselves. That's not very likely though because humans are constantly finding new ways to challenge themselves and often seek new frontiers. The aid of computers allow us to explore comets but humans still have to make the objects to explore those comets and write the code. There will always need to be an initial idea from a human to spark something new. Even if we reach singularity and AI is so advanced it can simulate being human, humans will still write novels and make games and come up with new inventions and make art as they have for the past 100,000 years of new technological advancements.
A20X14OMRL0YPZ	essay2	The major cities would represent a lot of characteristics in a society. If one looks at the ruins of a Mayan city, they find religious altars, schools, gathering places, and courts for their games. These far outlast the remnants of farming or trails that journey to important vacation spots in the countryside. A city may not represent everything in a society, but it can highlight important parts. If one goes to Tokyo, they find the Shinto and Buddhist shrines sandwiched between cherry blossom lanes, subway stations, and centers for technological innovation. Some cities may highlight certain aspects of culture more, as Kyoto's rich history, palaces, and modern day geisha highlight the important histories to Japan in a way Tokyo does not, but each city will highlight some of the most important characteristics to Japanese society as a whole. A country town might have a few of these things but a daily life of toil won't show philosophical ideals as well in the countryside.
A20X14OMRL0YPZ	essay3	The #MeToo movement is run on scandals and has highlighted many issues that deal with patriarchal control of females in a way that people have paid attention to and to which people are willing to listen. There are many Harvey Weinsteins in the world, but a lot of woman have been silenced for many reasons in the past. The scandal the movement creates holds a sway and power that has not been seen previously. Another example is the AIDS drug price hike by a very large percentage causing people to look at how drug companies operate. Many companies did this before but the scandal caused the FDA to investigate this case. It can serve as a jumping off point in a way many people who have sought reform could never have served as. It sets precedent the way a legal case might set precedent. People know what's wrong, how to deal with it, and how to bring about some small change due to these scandals now. Scandals will never solve a problem on their own but they can bring attention to problems so that more people can help find solutions to them.
A2196WCNDZULFS	essay1	I agree that as people rely more on technology to solve problems, the ability for humans to think for themselves will deteriorate. I have seen many examples of this happening already. For instance, most children and young adults have no idea how to use a phone book. Instead, they simply rely on a Google search to find the needed information. In a lot of schools, children aren't taught spelling any more. It seems that the powers that be have decided to make children rely on tools such as spell check instead of giving them the basic foundation needed to be successful in life. It is scary to see humans rely so heavily on something that could be gone in the blink of an eye.
A2196WCNDZULFS	essay2	"I feel that while it is important to study major cities in order to understand the important characteristics of society, it is equally important to study the people and culture from all areas. Major cities have a vastly different ""life force"" than small, rural towns. To understand society, every aspect must be taken into consideration. What may seem like the less important, less exciting parts cannot be overlooked. Many people exist in modern society who will never step foot into a major city, they must be studied as well. To understand society, one needs a comprehensive, all-encompassing view."
A2196WCNDZULFS	essay3	"Unfortunately, in today's society, scandals get more news coverage than just talking about an important issue would receive. A great example is the current women's movement, which is getting a lot of attention due to the many scandals involved. There have always been whispers, and in some cases, shouts, of women being harassed, mistreated, and abused. It had been fairly easy to brush the issue under the rug until a large number of women spoke out, creating a ""scandal."" Wile the term ""scandal"" can have negative connotations, scandals aren't always a bad thing."
A21SIPO89DP66I	essay1	I do not agree that human thought would deteriorate just because we have technology that can assist us; if anything, it will spur more curiosity, since simpler, mundane tasks will be easier to tackle.  Curiosity is one of the strongest driving forces in the world, because without it, we can have no invention; no one would consider improving their lives.  Having technology to assist our thinking can allow us to break into realms of thought we'd never thought of before, but drastically reducing the time it takes to research things, and also by allowing us to share our thoughts and our work with others, and improve on our own faults, while being able to positively critique the thoughts and work of others.  Additionally, we do not know how many times throughout human history someone has made great strides in their work, but ended up leaving it incomplete due to their mortality and lack of time; with technology at our back, it can be far easier for us to get our work done in a timely fashion, or even to build upon the work of others.
A21SIPO89DP66I	essay2	I think this is somewhat incomplete - or it allows for incomplete thoughts and results.  The most important characteristics of a society are found as a medium that exists in all parts of society; to only look within the major cities means that you might focus on something that those outside of the city might not engage in.  I can understand that with a great population density, one might believe they can reasonably judge what the people are like, but without knowing and seeing all of the people, you cannot pronounce any type of judgement and claim that it is representative of all of the people.  Therefore, in order to find the most important traits and thoughts of a society, you must see representatives from all of the parts.  If you do not, you are only seeing part of the picture, and often times, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.
A21SIPO89DP66I	essay3	I disagree, because scandals are nothing more than attention grabs.  Think of a clickbait, but only in real life.  Sure, you might be shocked about something, but the entire premise of the scandal is that everyone is likely to be of the same opinion; that the action in question was of a high shock value.  I understand that someone may specifically and purposely cause a scandal to push an issue, but we have another phrase for that - publicity stunt.  When someone feels that they must resort to voicing public scandal, I have a hard time putting any stock into them, because the best way to send a message is by being positive or constructive.  The goal should always be to find a way to improve how things are done, and voicing scandal is nothing more than breaking someone or something down.
A21WX8SSWIBC6G	essay1	I'm in agreement because technology is making things easier for everyone, making people stop thinking because technology makes everything easier
A21WX8SSWIBC6G	essay2	I agree, we should know their culture, their habits and all the things they do to know them perfectly
A21WX8SSWIBC6G	essay3	I disagree because this may draw attention but in a bad way since we do not focus well on what we are listening to
A228YSXU6H27QT	essay1	I'd have to agree with this statement. We've already seen throughout the last decade with the wealth of information at people's fingertips, they're more likely to rely on someone else's answer that they can find with a quick internet search than learning the information on their own for future use. Children these day's are more apt to cheat on exams as answers are readily available for them where they won't have to do any thinking or learning at all, and can just plug in answers they found from someone else's work. Including computer algorithms that can automatically decipher math problems. We're currently in the advanced stages of self driving cars, taking the human element completely out of it, it's only a matter of time before more things move this way as well. With more advancements in technology, the ability of humans to think for themselves will absolutely deteriorate.
A228YSXU6H27QT	essay2	I agree. The most diverse areas of a society are certainly major cities. The highest populations in a society are located within larger cities so it's only natural to find the most diverse group of people. By doing this, you can find many different characteristics of a particular society instead of narrowing the search down to a rural community where everyone lives a very similar life and many have the same basic characteristics. Studying different people of different backgrounds that currently co inhabit one particular society can field many different results and would be the best option to do so.
A228YSXU6H27QT	essay3	"I'm not sure I agree with this statement. While scandals certainly give a broad overview and details surrounding something that's ""eye catching"", there are a multitude of people who can write very articulately to describe the situation. Just as if reading a novel, with a good author you can become so enthralled with the story that you can feel like you're actually there. A scandal is really just an over sensationalized report of information, not necessarily painting a more vivid picture of events than a speaker or reformer could. More often than not, I'd prefer to read something directly from an informed source because they typically are more detailed than a scandal or report of the like."
A22ABLVEI5EGPL	essay1	Relying on technology does not diminish mankind's ability to think for themselves. Delegating tasks to machines or programs allows people to quickly solve problems where a solution has already been found. Humanity will never run out of problems to solve. There are always new things to discover about the universe. Solving problems with technology can also bring up ethical and moral problems that people need to explore. For example, self driving cars will someday be the normal mode of transportation. This advancement in technology will need to be surrounded by new laws to protect people on the road.
A22ABLVEI5EGPL	essay2	Humanty's advancements have largely been made in areas where people from many different cultures have come together and exchanged ideas. These highly populated areas are also where conflicting view points are also likely to meet. Major cities provide a large and diverse sample of society. Smaller areas also have important cultural contributions but generally provide a more homogeneous sample of society. Rural communities tend to be less diverse. Major cities also serve as centers for trade, education, and artistic pursuits. Studying these aspects is important
A22ABLVEI5EGPL	essay3	Scandals generally serve as a distraction from larger issues. It is very easy for powerful figures to frame and control the narrative surrounding a scandal. They can use the scandal drown out any voices in the media that they do not want to be heard. Scandals surrounding issues like racism and sexual harassment are easily taken over by interest groups and movements looking to fulfill their own agendas. Riding a scandal's wake is an easy way for people to infiltrate and take over causes for political or monetary gain. This can cause society to lose focus on the subject or in some cases become tired of hearing about it.
A22C483XVJUP9Z	essay1	agree Humans are uniquely adept at using systems of symbolic communication (such as language and art) for self-expression and the exchange of ideas, and for organizing themselves into purposeful groups. Humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values
A22C483XVJUP9Z	essay2	Likeness of members in a social group is the primary basis of their mutuality. May be in the beginning assumed or real common lineage, tribal affinity, family benefit or the compactness due to a common to time inculcated between and among the members in the group the feeling of likeness. Likeness means mutuality, and that means Society.
A22C483XVJUP9Z	essay3	Enthrallment remains a major area of investigation within education, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology. Areas of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate attention, the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the tuning properties of sensory neurons, and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes like working memory and vigilance. A relatively new body of research, which expands upon earlier research within neuropsychology, is investigating the diagnostic symptoms associated with traumatic brain injuries and their effects on attention.
A22JBMOHQKHTSS	essay1	I agree with the statement that as humans rely more on technology to solve problems we will reduce our ability to think for ourselves.  I believe this because if you look at past generations we had people like the tv show Mcgyver who could fix or make just about anything with very little to work with.  You look at today's generation and you see a wildly different set of people whose first instinct is to go to google to find all the answers they may need or to use autocorrect to fix their grammar rather than learning proper grammar themselves.  Using technology to solve our problems such as poor grammar is resulting in people becoming lazy and no longer wishing to learn new skills or to find the answer for themselves they take the easy route and let technology do the work for them.  It is due to these reasons that I agree with the statement.
A22JBMOHQKHTSS	essay2	I agree that to understand societies characteristics one has to study the largest and most popular cities.  I believe this to be true because those major cities and popular cities are the ones where the root of society lies they're the ones setting the framework for society to follow and are the leaders of the pact as far as what is considered the social norm.  Social norms and society norms are constantly changing and it's usually tied to individuals or an area and in most cases, these two collide for example Hollywood is a trendsetter for Hollywood and most people look to follow individuals or cities they look up to.  So for one to learn about societies characteristics one must learn about those cities that everyone is looking at for guidance as a whole and that is shaping society as a whole and it's constantly changing so it's a longterm learning process and demands your attention whether you like it or not.
A22JBMOHQKHTSS	essay3	"I agree that scandals will cause people to focus on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.  I believe this because as most of as heard a hundred times in our lives ""actions speak louder than words"", it matters very little if someone tells you to think of your consequences and to never steal but when you see someone's actions cause consequences, for example, someone stealing something and then getting caught and being put in jail for that theft, that will make it as real as you can make it because it will show them that these scandalise actions do indeed occur and there are consequences to these actions.  I have a kid and I've lectured them about being a good person and to not do any morally wrong actions and until they see something it's just words which is why seeing things with your own eyes such as scandal are far more impactful than a few words ever could be."
A22LZ62E0UC4VL	essay1	Technology is helping people solve many problems.  However, because technology is so useful, it is causing people to become more and more reliant on its usage.  People can no longer function without technology.  Soon, people will be unable to think for themselves because they place so much trust in technology.  Technology is also becoming more and more advanced that people no longer have to do things on their own.  For example, there are now self-driving cars.  As more features like this become available, people will not need to think as much.
A22LZ62E0UC4VL	essay2	In order to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.  The major cities are very representative of how the society operates.  There are many more people in these major cities, so there is a bigger sample size to cull data from.
A22LZ62E0UC4VL	essay3	Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.  Scandals are real life examples that can show us what not to do.  They are learning experiences.  It is also something that happened.  It is not staged.  It is genuine.
A23EWFNNOUS10B	essay1	I believe the statement is referencing artificial intelligence technology. The advancement of this technology will indeed cause humans thinking capacity to diminish over time as we rely more and more on machines to do our daily tasks. We will eventually evolved into a species that are completely dependent on machines which will cripple us both physically and mentally. The statement might not hold true if we develop technology as a companion to humans and not complete crutch to take over all of our thinking and physical activities. My opinion is primarily shaped by what I see in today's age in media and scientific articles. A lot of the technology is still in it's infancy but can still give a glimpse into what the future will be like.
A23EWFNNOUS10B	essay2	I agree with the statement because major cities usually have been around the longest. Major cities can give good insight into exactly how societies work and how we can improve upon them based on their past performance and problems. This statement might not hold true however if the city is relatively new or has seen dramatic changes over time both good and bad. Ideally one would want to examine an older city that has been around a very long time that has increased its productivity and quality of living in a linear fashion over time. If we model after successful cities it can really help to improve upon existing ones and provide a way for people to build future cities after while making them better. Our main goal should really be to improve what we can going forward and learn from our mistakes.
A23EWFNNOUS10B	essay3	Scandals can bring both the best and the worst out of people. They can dramatically thrust major issues into the spotlight thanks to the media and news outlets. When they come to light it really can also help to improve on existing problems in our society such as sexual harassment or racism as people have someone or something to devote their energy to. It is much easier to support a topic when we have a direction to go in and are fighting for a cause or issue that we really care about. as we have seen in recent media, there is a strong push for reform in several areas of our society. The most compelling reason scandals are useful because it almost takes on a persona of its own when the media gets a hold of it. Small issues that people would consider insignificant can suddenly be at the front page of all newspapers and on every channel.
A24LUXW1DB1QI5	essay1	The ability of people to think for themselves isn't deteriorating, it is merely evolving. The process for problem solving and information gathering has changed, but so has the skill set. As technology is constantly changing, with new resources becoming available all the time, people are required to constantly adapt to and learn new skills. Furthermore, technology may make information more readily available, but it does not make decisions for you. Ultimately, technology is a tool to be used in problem solving, but does not replace human judgement.
A24LUXW1DB1QI5	essay2	"To learn about society as a whole, one must study as diverse a pool as possible. To only study major cities would narrow the focus too much to make any generalized observations about society as a whole. One may find that characteristics prevalent in a major city may less in a suburb or absent in a rural community. Another flaw in this reasoning is the phrase ""important characteristics"". When studying anything, specifics are important. Are you looking to find the most common characteristics or the ones that have the greatest impact on society?"
A24LUXW1DB1QI5	essay3	"Historically this may have been true. Watergate comes to mind as a scandal that brought many secrets out to the public. However, that was a different time when news outlets were more limited and less sensational. As it stands now, in the era of viral videos and 24 hours news channels, ""scandals"" occur too frequently to have the same impact. We have become desensitized as a society to shocking news. In fact, we've come to expect it."
A250HYHFGXESAC	essay1	I disagree. You actively have to think for you to do anything that has to do with technology. When I get a text or an email or anything of the sort I have to make the decision to engage. Now, if you mean think for themselves as in can't make  their own decisions without using technology to get approval that is already happening. Look how many people need approval  or motivation just to do anything with their daily life. #goingtothegym that kind of nonsense. Cultivate self discipline and the machines won't take over!
A250HYHFGXESAC	essay2	I disagree. Every person is different. Every city. town, village, is different than the next. People in NYC don't act or behave the way more rural area people act. To understand the most important characteristics of a society one must actively search out discussions with a very diverse focus groups from all locations. Major cities of course being one of them but not limited to urban living environments.
A250HYHFGXESAC	essay3	Depends on the scandal. For one if it's a celebrity cheating scandal, nobody should care. It doesn't affect you or your day to day at all. Imagine this, sorry boss I can't make it into work kim kardashian cheated on kanye... Now if we are talking about political leaders then yes. They have NO shame at all in the way they operate or govern. Scandals are the only way any of their back room dealings come to light. Now whether they see punishment for it or not is a whole other situation.
A2541C8MY0BYV3	essay1	I definitely think that as we rely more on technology, our ways of thinking will NOT deteriorate. The reason is because technology is only there to assist us in what we need to do like driving. It will never be able to take over things or decisions that we have to make because sometimes emotions play a bit part in that. A robot will never be able to make a decision that a human makes that involves emotions because they do not have that. I also think that the only way we will have better technology, is if humans get smarter to make them. This means that humans will evolve along with robots. I also think that humans will never trust robots 100% because everyone deep down has some concern as to how much you can really trust robots.
A2541C8MY0BYV3	essay2	I definitely agree with this notion. The reason is because the major cities show you how people live.  The way people interact and evolve in a city, shows you what kind of people reside there. If a major city has people that are always busy, this shows you that society is improving and that people are working. If a major city has many homeless people, this shows you that society as a whole is getting more lazy. If a major city has many different types of people or races, this will show you that society is evolving and our mindsets are different now. We are able to adapt to people of different races and religions and we can accept people for who they really are.
A2541C8MY0BYV3	essay3	"I think that scandals are definitely useful because it is a ""problem"". Generally, people are pretty nosy and when a scandal arises, the first thing people want to do is see what the problem is. Espesically in times like this with social media dominating everything, scandals can spread quick and easily. A speaker would never be able to do this because it would just bore most of the people in our generation. If you want people to be interested in a problem, the best way is a scandal. People are more interested in drama and scandals can spice that up."
A256FHXGSY0E5D	essay1	I disagree, yes humans will have to think about current matters less but that doesn't mean they'll stop thinking. With technology solving all of our current problems it will enable humans to think in-depth about future problems. We'll be able to pursue goals and leisure activities that we didn't previously have time for. With less time invested in worrying about problems, more time can be invested in just idle thought and the pursuit of self improvement. Humanity has never stagnated, humanity is driven to always improve and always find something new and I doubt any amount of technology will ever change that.
A256FHXGSY0E5D	essay2	Cities are almost always an outlier compared to the population of the country they're in. Take NYC and LA for examples, they're some of the most liberal places in the US. However if you leave those places even within the same state you'll still run into a lot of close minded individuals who hold conservative beliefs. If cities were representative of the society they belong to then things like Donald Trump getting elected would never have happened. Fact is cities are the exception and not the rule in many cases when it comes to societies and their behaviors.
A256FHXGSY0E5D	essay3	Scandals do nothing but distract society from more important things. It's become a common tactic among politics for a 'scandal' to suddenly leak when a politician is doing crap he shouldn't be. While media is whipping the nation into a frenzy about the scandal the politician is free to keep doing his usual corrupt crap without any oversight. Scandals have their place in certain situations sure, but the days of allowing these scandals to take over all forms of news needs to stop. Once people know about the scandals and understand what is going on with them then they don't need to have it brought up every 5 minutes on every form of media that they ingest.
A2581F7TDPAMBQ	essay1	"I feel we live in a crazy world today, for many reasons. One of the most prominent is due to the fact that everything is seemingly done on automatic. Amazing advances in technology has made life incredibly easy in many ways. We tend to depend so heavily on such technology, that we tend to lose sight of the life before us. We are not able to engage, to think to grow in an emotionally satisfying way. Instead, we are only concerned in today, and how we can impress others. We neglect understanding concepts and emotions on a human level. Children, sadly, will lose so much of the imagination that we had as children. They instead will be caught up in a fantasy world free of feelings and knowledge. Bonds will be looser, and minds will remain small. So maybe these advances aren't ""advances"" at all."
A2581F7TDPAMBQ	essay2	Being objective is a huge part of making reliable conclusions. In any area, there seems to be very prominent trends among people. This being the case, sampling only those who are must more likely to think, act, and live their lives similarly tells us very little about societies in general. If, on the other hand, you visit a large, diverse city you will come across a wide array of people. People who have different views, beliefs and ways of life. People who have passions and ambitions that are completely different from their neighbors.
A2581F7TDPAMBQ	essay3	"Everyone loves a good scandal, or so they say. While we can easily obtain information daily from various news outlets, or simply from daily occurrences, there is just something about a thickening plot that truly engages our interest. I believe that people like to see ""The good guy win"", and having this outcome up in the air creates a sense of suspense that can truly keep us eager and guessing. Also, I feel that in some ways, it is simply a wonderful escape from an otherwise mundane life."
A25CFVQND4A0EV	essay1	I think that argument is false. Technology is a way for us to access information very quickly, so if someone doesn't know something they will look it up and find out. This doesn't mean they're any more reliant on the technology compared to people of older generations, because if someone didn't know something 50 years ago they probably would just guess about it. I think that these tools will help people exercise their mind and their full potential without having to jump through hurdles to get knowledge and information. The more that we use technology the more we can improve it to be reliable and strengthen our minds and our skills in case this technology isn't available in the future. Just like when people invented paper, people didn't rely on the paper to store information and thus lose the ability to store information in their minds.
A25CFVQND4A0EV	essay2	"This is true for the most part. Some of the rich cultures of a society are often found in the cities and larger populated areas. This does of course depend, some places you may find a richer culture in rural areas. Metropolitan areas sometimes lose their traditional ways to globalization, rural areas tend to retain the rich traditional culture. But cities often to develop their own unique characteristics that make them stand out from the rest of the world. Some countries like Japan really take pride in their unique ways of living, eating, etc and they aren't widely influenced by ""westernization."" In a board sense, it's best to look at the densely and sparsely populated areas to get a good grasp of what a society is like overall."
A25CFVQND4A0EV	essay3	I think that scandals strike a cord of interest in a lot of people's psychology and that's natural. It often involves being called out and criticized for an appalling act, so there's a tribal mentality to it that people latch on to and get enjoyment from. Speakers and reformers tell of things that have yet to happen and may never happen, so the excitement and visceral feeling of a scandal are just more sensational and appealing to most people. However, there are some incredibly captivating speakers out there who can get people excited about the issues in society and really work to enact change. It's not always black and white, sometimes scandals don't strike as much of an interest and a reformer genuinely could grab more attention.
A25FH7PXC446RG	essay1	You can already see this deteriorating with our youth.  Most children have cell phones or have ipad's in classrooms.  If you ask any child to look at a clock and ask them to tell you the time their answer would be they do not know.  Most children have a phone to look at that will tell them time.  Going to the library to get a physical book will no longer be in existance.  Most people read with their kindle.
A25FH7PXC446RG	essay2	This is true for large citis and small.  If you go to a large city it is more industrial.  It has all the latest trends when it comes to restaurants and clothing stores.  It is more fast pace and liberal.  If you go to smaller towns you will notice a close knit community that is slower in pace.  These tend to be more conservative.
A25FH7PXC446RG	essay3	The  media has the ability to spread knowledge of a scandal further than ever before because of social media. By creating scandals it takes our focus away from the true problems of our society.  People believe what the emdia tells them.
A2620VELR4LMLU	essay1	We see already that human capacity to think for yourself has deteriorated. By simply giving authority to politicians and leaders we have lost some of our ability to do this. Now, with increasing levels of technology spoon feeding us the best course of action it will only get worse. Our decision making will turn largely into trying to decide what technology to trust, instead of trying to figure out, on our own, what we should do. Think of modern navigation, usually it uses a phone app, people simply follow along with what it tells them to do.
A2620VELR4LMLU	essay2	To the extent that large portions of a societies citizens live in cities this is true. However, let us not confuse society with civilization. Civilization has cities, societies might not. Hunter-gatherers had no cities but assuredly had society. In any modern civilization it is necessary to study major cities to understand important characteristics. A huge portion of the population live in cities. It is important to not that the culture in cities is often different from that outside of cities. Also, cities are the centers of power for modern society. You cannot understand government without understanding the major cities.
A2620VELR4LMLU	essay3	Scandals are largely a distraction from real issues or a way of focusing on a real issue that tends to trivialize it. Often scandals capture the public attention but are focused on relatively unimportant issues. Such as a politician who cheated on his wife. One may be legitimately appalled by such behavior, but in the grand scheme of politics it doesn't matter. Sometimes, scandals take a real issue and trivialize it by making the whole thing into a sort of spectacle. It becomes entertainment to the viewer of the media, rather than being educational. The scandal is presented in such a way that intrigue captures the mind.
A267GLM78AMQ75	essay1	I agree with this. The fact that we rely on technology now more than ever is disturbing. Right now we rely on technology for information, what to expect, etc. Before you know it, our cars are gonna be driving us around, which in itself is a bit terrifying, due to the fact that our own lives will be in the hands of technology and software. Human thinking is definitely deteriorating due to this.
A267GLM78AMQ75	essay2	I don't agree with this. There are all types of different people scattered everywhere throughout the united states. If you were to understand what the most important characteristic of a society is, you need to study the individuals themselves, not where they live. People everywhere are different and not everyone is influenced by how others are in their city or how the city itself is. So with those reasons being stated, I think this is wrong.
A267GLM78AMQ75	essay3	Scandals are anything but useful. Scandals are only around to grab the attention of viewers, and to put the bad spotlight on the one being involved in the scandal. If our society has gotten to the point where only scandals grab our attention more than what is actually important, then I worry for our future generations. Scandals are over-hyped and over-dramatic in order to get and keep the attention of the ones who only care for drama. So with that being said, I fully disagree with that statement.
A26A4HEBGP2MOX	essay1	I have to say that I somewhat disagree with this statement. While technology in some aspects takes away some ability to think, it also encourages thinking. I mean this in respect to people having to think of new technologies, and different ways to apply existing technology. We will always need inventors, and we will always need people to solve any technical problems.  I also think that technology will play an important role within college institutions. Whether it is educating students remotely, or if it involves the student taking courses related to technology. It is the future of coming generations, and will only get more advanced.
A26A4HEBGP2MOX	essay2	This makes sense to an extent. In most cases the major cities of a society has people from all walks of life. Rich, poor, and middle class. All races, and genders. On the other hand rural ares have people that live a different way of life. Take for example the Amish population in Pennsylvania. These people don't generally go into the city, and tend to live off the grid. I would also take the homeless population into consideration. I think that to understand a society as a whole, one must take into consideration, people from all walks of life in that particular region. One should also study the government of the area in which they are studying. Taking into account people's political preferences.
A26A4HEBGP2MOX	essay3	I am going to have to disagree. What I have actually noticed is that scandal's tend to take your mind off of what the real issues are. Take for example the Stormy Daniel's case. The major news media outlet's focus on this issue too much because it brings in ratings. But they don't focus on the fact that most Americans want to talk about having universal healthcare for all. This is one of many policies that really matter to the people. Not who Donald Trump may or may not have slept with in the past. Another issue the media blows out of proportion is the Russian interference issue. While it very well may be important to discuss, it takes away from other pressing issues that matter more. I think many of these so called scandals are a waste of precious time, and take too much away from the national conversa
A26RO8GGTQAXGG	essay1	People will always think about the things, but the topics will change. We think more and more about making machines that can provide convenience. We think less about basic needs like farm machinery. We think about rolling coolers that can charge our phones to play music while we party. The ability to shove some thinking onto machines will mean we move onto thinking about other things. Machines need people to make them
A26RO8GGTQAXGG	essay2	I disagree. The cities tend to be amalgams and where newcomers arrive first. Cities are where blending occurs. The countryside is here the most basic cultural lements are visible. What plants and animals generated sufficient surplus to allow development of music and other arts, expressions. What materials fueled the baisc technologies that also added to the surplus. What was the focus of the earliest art forms like fabrics and folk songs. Did they venerate a place? A plant? A certain god or goddess? The rural areas are the purest form of a culure still extant
A26RO8GGTQAXGG	essay3	Hmmm. Insightful. Heard a recent pundit say that if we had paid more attention to white collar corruption and financial rules being pushed to the limit, we would have been spared the trumptrocious misadministration. I agree that attention to bad behavior is good. I disagree that they always lead to good results because we focus on the prurient details, pussy grabbing, rather than the concretely unethical like paying bribes thru mobsters to get a building built. Exposing bad behavior is very good. But do not senationalize details for profit. That should be a scandal, too.
A26XF8O4XRL8JA	essay1	   I both agree and disagree that people rely more on technology to solve problems, their ability to think for themselves will deteriorate.  I think the more information available to us the better off we are.  I think technology allows us to see things in ways we never have before and with solutions we may have never known.  However, in some subjects like math, I do believe people rely heavily on calculators to help them.  Spelling seems to be another issue,with auto correct people seem less concerned with their lack of spelling abilities.  Spelling tests are no longer given at my children's elementary school.  In conclusion I think there are both positive and negative points to technology increasing to solve problems.
A26XF8O4XRL8JA	essay2	   I agree that to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.  We need to look at how the city was formed and the thoughts behind how it was curated.  We can tell a lot about what is important to the society by what is in the city.  Looking at how people live within the city and function together we can examine values of the culture.  We can also learn a lot by looking at the different people interact and how they get along, what the roles are within the city.  The major cities of a society are usually major hubs and can tell us much more than small town.  In conclusion, I think  we can tell a lot about a society by studying its major cities.
A26XF8O4XRL8JA	essay3	     I agree that scandals can focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.  Scandals can rip an issue right open.  Usually it is bringing up something that few people directly involved in would talk about.  It opens our eyes to issues that happening around us.  Scandals can give us first hand accounts of problems we may not have known existed.  On the other hand, speakers and reformers are usually knowledgeable about a topic, and often have experience with the topic.  I think they could have valuable insight to problems as well.  We can learn so much from many sources.  I think both speaker and reformers as well as scandals can teach us about problems and focus our attention on those problem.
A27EIUC6R63WY7	essay1	The bone of contention lies in reasoning of an individual which gets paralyzed thanks to daily assault that human brain faces with simple click. Yes ‘the simple click/tap’ that generates a simple yes or displays complex results in matter of seconds. Human brain stops questioning the how? and Why?, affecting its critical ability to perceive things.
A27EIUC6R63WY7	essay2	In today's Contemporary and fast paced world, each country's major cities play a very important role in  deciding the economic, social as well as political status of a country. The major cities reflect upon the  overall development and provide a bird's view of that country.
A27EIUC6R63WY7	essay3	onceded that scandals reveals the sinful veracity of the people who usually get involve in abject to earn money as well as name and fame. Moreover, all these things help people to know; what is the reality of elites like actors, ministers, preceptors and so forth whereas reformers lagged regard of these level articles.
A27O2IILV3S5YS	essay1	I agree with this statement for the most part. Let's examine a math problem or math problems overall for example. Rather than relying on one's mind, we look to the internet to find calculators or other formulas to answer the question for us. Sure it saves us time, but we aren't really doing ourselves any favors and we certainly are not learning.  While it can admirable to ask people online in advice columns etc for answers or guidance to our problems, I think we know the answers to those questions already. We just look for validation from others. We also could be asking our family or close friends, which can enhance a relationship and bring people closer together but instead, we use technology to find those answers.  We look for answers on how to fix the smallest of things. Mend a pair of socks, or fix a broken hinge on a door; we can figure those things out ourselves, or by going to the library, instead, we look to online forums to answer those questions. Yes, they are helpful but our minds deteriorate in this manner of doing things. We don't need cell phones communicate with people, we can speak to them face to face building better relationships at the same time.
A27O2IILV3S5YS	essay2	I agree with this statement. One of our major cities in the United  States is Washington D.C. If we want to take a look at important characteristics of our society, we need only look at who is in congress and the white house. If we appear to be devoid of empathy, human compassion, all the things that make people, human, we need to look at who creates our laws. Those laws are the hallmark of our societies. We can see the countless homeless people lining the streets, the people demonstrating in those streets; there are many things we can see in this city that reflect who we are as a society. If we want to change that, we have to change who we put in positions of power. If we want compassionate, ethical leadership, we need to vote that in, otherwise, our society changes for the worse. At this moment, our society values companies more than people, we value corruption more than accountability and this is reflected in everyday life in America. Society changes when leadership does.
A27O2IILV3S5YS	essay3	I agree with this. If we look at the recent #metoo movements, we can see this clearly. Sexual harassment is a scandal and many have been found to be guilty of these crimes. It has showcased who abused power by allowing us to read the harrowing tales of their victims. A speaker who discusses sexual harassment can have a small impact but the stories of real victims, numerous victims, puts the issue at the forefront and forces us to confront the issue. It forces us to talk about it and find solutions to the problem. The #metoo movement has brought the hidden sickness of sexual harassment, that many people both men and women have had to deal with for decades. We are not having much-needed conversations. Those who are the perpetrators of these crimes have been exposed and shunned.  Have they lost everything? Not yet, but some will be prosecuted and some won't be able to show their faces in public for many years to come. This is far more than a speaker can do in my opinion. People can walk away from a speech on sexual harassment or other issues, but you can't walk away from the scandal that is at the forefront of newscasts every night.
A27SMEOPKV84VI	essay1	"I agree that as people rely more on technology, our ability to think on our own lessens.  I see this in my children compared to when I was growing up.  I would have to research things, or find creative solutions to problems as I couldn't just ""google"" for an answer.  My children think that if they can't find an immediate answer online, then there must not be an solution that they can use.  Instead, they give up until the teachers walk them through the issue multiple times.  I just don't feel like the ability to retain information when we are training our brains to just type in a question is happening anymore.  Self-sufficiency is becoming scarce and I fear that my children will be lacking life skills when they are adults."
A27SMEOPKV84VI	essay2	I don't necessary agree that major cities are the key to finding out important characteristics of a society.  I live near a bigger city, but rarely venture out there.  I'm still able to learn our culture just by interacting with local people of my own small town, who may have had adventures in the cities.  Our society is dependent on the whole of its people, not just those accustomed to the business of city life.  When I am traveling, I don't necessarily want to spend time in the city either.  Its too busy, too touristy.  You can find some of the best kept secrets and people off the beaten path.  They really bring the culture of their desired locations out.  They are not competing with five other restaurants, hotels, or stores that are within the same block.  So they can really let themselves shine and take the time needed to show off local culture and traditions.
A27SMEOPKV84VI	essay3	I do not believe scandals are useful at all.  They just put things into the limelight that would be insignificant to others that were not in a position of power.  Let's look at Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski. Sure - he was the president and should not have cheated on his wife.  However, this wouldn't have remained in the papers and talked about 20 years later if it had been the president of a local wallpaper manufacturing company.  His personal life shouldn't have been allowed to overshadow the decisions he made for the country professionally.  Scandals just detract from other important issues that should be allowed to have airtime instead.  They get blown out of proportion as the public takes sides and fuel the fire.
A28SYXQL3YOKVL	essay1	I disagree that technology will hinder people's ability to think for themselves. I think technology will only advance human thinking and understand, and provide us with new ways to think and grow. Machines and technology should be seen as tools to advance mankind's thought,. Each new development will usher in new ways to problem solve. We stand on the shoulders of giants. Progress advances human condition.
A28SYXQL3YOKVL	essay2	Major cities are macrocosms of society. Every instance and example of humanity can be expected to be found there. The close knit populace becomes a volatile melting pot of culture and individuality. Every aspect of human life can be explored. From the stratification of the inner city, to the opulence of high rise apartments and luxury hotels, to the communities of workers and commuters form other areas, the city has it all. All cultures, races, creeds, religions and body types fuse in a melange of experience.
A28SYXQL3YOKVL	essay3	Scandals can often highlight the faults in the systems we think protect us. For example, the Reagan presidency taught us about treason through it's Iran Contra scandal. The Bush administration taught us another lesson about treason when it started an illegal war to make American contracting companies richer. Scandals have much to teach us. A growing scandal in America seems to be that, power and wealth allow those who hold them the freedom to ignore all laws, morality, and even basic decency that all humans should be afforded. What will we learn from them? Only time will tell.
A28T38MOUG43YD	essay1	"I disagree strongly with this idea that technology inhibits the idea of free thought or problem solvings. Technology and advancement has always been and in my mind will always be a quality of life type. That is that technology allows things to be done easier, tasks that used to take long amounts of time have been shortened and made easier. All of this means that we as a society can free think much more often as there is more time. Technology is not a crutch or some type of training wheels as much as it is likea type of energy drink or some other supplements. It gives us access to so much. After all someone had to design the tech that solved that ""problem"". While it is true that advancement can harm us i do not think it will harm us from a thinking standpoint"
A28T38MOUG43YD	essay2	I do not agree with important characteristics as much as i would say majority characteristics. The things that are most important to a society will not always been seen up front in a major city but are usually seen in their communities and on a smaller scale overall. Along with that what is important to a society changes from person to person so judging this is very difficult
A28T38MOUG43YD	essay3	I agree with this to an extent. A scandal is never a good look for all of the outside parties as it casts a shadow and doubt on the people. We should not have to be at the precipice or hit a breaking point in order to be forced to change. We should change as we see a decline and not have to wait for the dam to burst to get reform. Speakers and reform lead to small changes and fixes in a problem to ensure that things are not forced to burst and can be fixed over time.
A29AX5O8KL48F8	essay1	"Technology makes life easier, and people are able to solve problems faster, but this comes at a cost. Without technology, we had to work on our own carefully to figure out the correct answer. This ensured we were ""learning"" on our own, practicing the habit of problem solving, and giving us feedback when we were right or wrong (a reward). In the most simple example, take a person who wants to multiply a series of numbers. In the old days, he/she would have to write them all out on a piece of paper, do the work to get the answer, and then possibly do the work again to double check the answer. Noways, people only have to input the numbers and let technology do the work. The person in the old days who worked for their answer developed and honed their math skills while creating a better work ethic. It's a simple example, but already we can see two benefits from it."
A29AX5O8KL48F8	essay2	Major cities typically will encompass a diverse population, complete with all types of personalities, races and demographics. If you were to only study small cities, you would surely miss out on certain types of people. Major cities are a good way to ensure that everyone is included in the study. You will get the rich and the poor; the introverts and extroverts; the working class and the white collar types. Major cities are also the leading movers in trends and attitudes that will later influence the small cities. A major city represents the society best, as it ensures all people are included, and nobody is left out.
A29AX5O8KL48F8	essay3	"A scandal will bring an issue into the limelight and give us a real-life example of the problem and its effects on real people. People can be aware of issues and their hypothetical existence, but until a real case appears in the media, the average person will not feel the full emotion of the problem. Seeing it play out in the news, and being able to attach faces to victims or perpetrators, allows us to experience it personally. We can finally know the names of victims and hear their stories, and develop empathy. Our anger can be directed to a specific person, or group of people, who are the accused. It gives us a marker in history (or our memories) that allows us to stand up and say, ""We don't want this to happen ever again."" History books are filled with such stories. They drive home the importance of issues, and of people who one day made a difference."
A2A2CEBYMI2UNJ	essay1	I believe that technology has both good and bad aspects to it. As we have adopted more technology and it has become more integrated into our lives, our social abilities have deteriorated. Additionally, items such as calculators, which are good tools, make it so that we are not forced to do as many things by hand. This might seem to make a person lazier, but there are some benefits to this as well. For example, the time saved by using a device such as a calculator to complete a task can be used to complete more tasks than otherwise would be possible or to engage in learning about a new area of expertise. I do not think that it is inevitable that humans will lose the ability to think for themselves as technology is adopted. Rather, I believe that technology is a tool and it is up to the individual to decide whether they will use it to better themselves or allow themselves to become complacent.
A2A2CEBYMI2UNJ	essay2	Major cities can say a lot about a country on the whole. The infrastructure, plumbing, traffic and road conditions, relative wealthy/poor areas of the community and public transit can say a lot about the economics of a city, and by extension of the country as a whole. Of course, all countries will have cities that are better off, but these factors will show a general trend on how wealthy the residents are and what the government of the country deems to be the most important areas to spend money on. Also, information on how homeless or disadvantaged people are cared for provides information about the values of the country and its leaders on the whole. Also, cities are a good place to find information about the culture of a country, as they contain museums and art galleries and cultural exhibits that are not as common in rural areas. In short, if someone wants to learn about a country, it is good for them to study its major cities as they provide information about the countries values and culture.
A2A2CEBYMI2UNJ	essay3	When a scandal comes to light, it gets a lot of attention from the press and the media. This allows for the consumer to have a lot of information about what happened and who was involved that they would otherwise likely not have had access to. When a person is going about their daily life in a normal way they are far less likely to get media coverage or be memorable. Additionally, scandals help to challenge a belief or a commonly accepted way of doing things, and may help to change the culture or political climate of a country. Scandals are not all bad-some of them encourage us to think of ideas and information we would not have otherwise considered.
A2AMBJ0RTXFLPC	essay1	"Why think when you have your smartphone in your pocket.  It is the case in too many circumstances.  Children in high school are allowed to use their phones in class, take test on the computer, and not have to remember much of anything but the  basics anymore.  The way children are taught in this day and age only escalate the problem.  If you want a child to learn and remember what they learn, they have to have repetition and writing of what they need to know.  I think that given the way computers are introduced at such a young age makes things harder for them to learn what they really need to learn.  I hear ""just ask Siri"" all the time."
A2AMBJ0RTXFLPC	essay2	I guess if you did not know about the  most popular cities that you would not know much about the characteristics of that society.  I also believe that you need to learn some about the smaller cities too, though.  There are many more smaller cities that are nothing like the large ones, so just learning about the large cities would not make you understand all of the characteristics of a society  There are many people that act nothing like big city people.  You need to learn the farmland as well..
A2AMBJ0RTXFLPC	essay3	Scandals are what makes us interested.  You see many more people watching the news these days because there are so many scandals going on.  Many of which, we would know nothing about unless  they have made there way into a scandal.  Many scandals are made to look that way just to get our attention, but when you find out all the facts, you realize there was no scandal at all.  Its the way of life now that we have all the social media sites.  No one can do anything without the whole world finding out.  Whether it is a good thing or bad has yet to be determined.
A2B5HZBQ6C3J3L	essay1	"This is sort of a tricky one to answer. On the one hand, yes, humans will use technology more and more to solve problems, not only in the areas of mathematics but even common problems like diagnosing illnesses and that sort of thing. However, despite the fact that relying on machines might make people seem ""lazy"", I don't think it will deteriorate people's ability to think for themselves. Instead, people's thoughts will be put towards other things. Maybe these thoughts will be more towards ""the big picture"" rather than considering the small details, or maybe they'll go towards towards something else entirely; I don't know. The one thing I do know is that people will not ever stop thinking. And besides, there will always be people who have to be there to create and program the technology, and that does indeed require a lot of complex knowledge and deep thought. Thus my overall opinion is that people's ability to think for themselves won't deteriorate."
A2B5HZBQ6C3J3L	essay2	"A society's major cities is only fraction of a given society, and usually a pretty small amount of it. I think the more important aspects of a society is in its rural areas. The values and ways of life of rural people are oftentimes purer and more straightforward than those of city folk. More importantly, rural people tend to have views that are more in line with the founders of a given society (e.g. in the USA, rural people strongly align with the ""Founding Fathers""). Not to mention, rural areas are generally where the bulk of a nation's agriculture is found, which is usually the backbone of a given society's economy."
A2B5HZBQ6C3J3L	essay3	This is unfortunately true. I think psychology studies have shown time and again that people react more strongly to negative events than positive ones. Everyone loves Martin Luther King Jr. now, but many in America wouldn't listen to him until after he was shot dead. Who knows how effective his campaign would have been had he not become an unwitting martyr? And nowadays, when you think of the #MeToo movement, do you realize how many years people had been pushing for more awareness of sexual assault victims and to listen to their stories? It wasn't until some major scandals broke out involving household names (notably Bill Cosby) and powerful Hollywood figures (namely Harvey Weinstein) that people took notice. So undoubtedly, the claim about scandals is true.
A2BF3A9KYSEFPO	essay1	I completely with this statement.  Our brain, like our muscles, needs frequent stimulation in order to develop and maintain its functions during one's lifetime.  Technology takes away this stimulation, and we eventually become intellectually inactive.  Also, our creativity will be greatly suffered when technology plays so many roles in our daily activities.  We will get lazy in our trying to be creative in our daily life.  We do not care about thinking a new solution for a problem because
A2BF3A9KYSEFPO	essay2	Major cities have their pros and cons.  However, a major city has more pros than cons in comparison to rural areas.  Economically, major cities reflect the true picture of our modern society; the current trends and social future are blending and presenting in the economy of major cities.  Culturally, major cities are the most appropriate places if one to learn about the culture of a specific region.  Because of the diversity of a major city, we will see the different cultural background of that region.
A2BF3A9KYSEFPO	essay3	I do not think that scandals are useful for our society.  I believe that the goal of any nation or each person is to make life a pleasant and worthy placto live.  I, therefore, believe that scandals not only negatively affects one's perception of life but also takes away our attention on improving and creating a perfect society for us to live in.  If we want to guide people to live decently and morally in a society or organization, we simply need to educate, encourage, and provide opportunities for them to be able to act and socialize appropriately in daily activities.
A2BGRGVU9HG0C6	essay1	With the availability of new technology people are becoming more lazy. People are very busy these days. Therefore, it is more convenient for them to rely on technology to help them function.  The more technology grows the less people have to think for themselves. Why think and physicallyrics do things when someone can do it for you?
A2BGRGVU9HG0C6	essay2	If you study major cities you learn  a lot of important things about how people function and how places prosper or grow. Looking at big cities you can gage what people like and what is not like to benefit others. There are more people there so a variety of people gives more aspect to what they want or do not want. Big cities give more business and ideas.
A2BGRGVU9HG0C6	essay3	I do not think scandals benefit anyone. Scandals only bring hard ache and shame. Who wants to have their dirty secrets share. Scandals embarrass innocent people like children and spouses who have did nothing wrong. People only bring out scandals to hurt others.
A2BNOEYZ3VRW2R	essay1	"I have seen this happening for a while, especially with my adult grandsons. When they visit, they are constantly checking their phones, even while carrying on a conversation. They don't give priority to the social situation; instead, they rely on their phone for distraction and amusement. I fear they will forget how to have a civilized and interesting conversation with anyone, especially during job interviews or areas where being able to express oneself is important. Another thing I fear, which is also happening already, is that machines will be the preferred companions (phones, robots, computers) instead of other humans. And another ""forgotten"" art will be that of writing and composing meaningful and thoughtful communication"
A2BNOEYZ3VRW2R	essay2	I agree this is true, because more attention is given to large population areas. We don't hear about how folks in Iowa react to major news, but New Yorkers' opinions are often expressed and heard by millions of Americans. And those comments have an effect on how society moves and changes. But I also believe another factor is television. Now THAT would be an interesting study--to see how society mirrors the most popular shows. I'm certain some crimes have been perpetrated by copying a show's plot. I know language certainly has. People use legal terminology now as if they'd attended law school because they hear it on TV. But people who live in large cities become a certain way that is different from Iowan
A2BNOEYZ3VRW2R	essay3	"Scandals can have positive results if they are not just salacious sexual hookups. But this ""me too"" movement is a watershed. This will cause a societal change of great magnitude and further the cause of women like no other. Harvey Weinstein is a sexual predator, yes, but it's because of his bad behavior and the strength of the women he assaulted that a change is being hade. I believe that men have gotten the message and will think twice before disrespecting women from here on. Women have tried for decades to get their freedom, and because of the Weinstein scandal, it seems to be taking place."
A2C84POENS2UNY	essay1	As people rely more on technology to solve their problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will not deterioriate.  We humans have used tools and devices to assist us with problem-solving for thousands of years.  The antikythera mechanism is an example of a several thousand year old device, or primitive computer, that was used by humans to chart the movement of planets and stars.  Thus, using technology to solve problems is not a novel or new phenomenon at all.  In order to use the correct technology and apply it appropriately, humans must engage in complex thinking.  We must think through the inputs to enter into technology in order to receive the outputs that we need to solve our issues.  We also must appropriately assess and analyze the information that we receive from technology in order to solve our problems.  Additionally, we often receive conflicting information from various technologies, and we must be able to synthesize these appropriately and determine which outputs are most useful to us and most valid.  As well, we must be able to select the appropriate technology to solve our particular issue.   As evidenced above, it is clear that using technology to solve our problems still requires a large amount of thought and analysis.  Humans have been using machines and equipment to help us with problem-solving for many centuries, and we will continue to do so.  This will, however, only serve to strengthen our problem-solving ability and further develop our minds.  It will give us the tools to acquire even more data that we must analyze and use to our benefits, and this requires deep-thinking and problem-solving skills.  Our ability to think for ourselves will only grow stronger as we partner with technology.
A2C84POENS2UNY	essay2	To understand the most important characteristics of a society, it is critical to study its major cities.  After all, it is in the cities that human populations are concentrated, and thus there will be more activity and more behavior to study and assess in a city.  While rural areas with less dense population do indeed show evidence of important characteristics to society, there will not be as much evidence to study when you examine these smaller locations.  In the cities, however, you will see a much more diverse group of people to study which will enable you to observe the most important characteristics to society.  For example, when studying the ancient cities of Greek and Rome, scientists have been able to learn a vast amount of information about the way humans used to live.  We have learned about the educational systems, political systems, infastructure systems, personal relationships, financial systems, and many other aspects of human life from examining ancient civilizations.  A large array of systems can be observed in a city, and these systems can help people learn the characteristics of society that are most prominent and important.  Due to the higher concentration of population in a city, there will be more opportunities to observe diverse and varying characteristics of humans living there, all of which are valuable when you are trying to learn about a society.  Therefore, it is important to study the major cities of a society in order to learn the most about its people and their way of life.  The cities will hold all the critical institutions - educational, political, financial, social, and otherwise - and will enable the learner to observe and understand the complex diversity of the humans in a given society.
A2C84POENS2UNY	essay3	Scandals are useful because they can focus our attention on problems in unique ways that no other person or group could achieve.  When a scandal occurs, oftentimes a critical situation that needs our attention is brought to view.  This enables us to address that situation so that hopefully it can be prevented in the future.  For example, the many sexual assault scandals that have been brought to light recently, such as that of Harvey Weinstein and many other famous figures, has brought to society's attention the prevalence of a culture that accepts sexual assault on women way too lightly.  While many speakers have addressed this issue for decades, none have brought as much societal attention and focus to it as the recent scandals that have captured the media and the public's attention.  As well, when Enron and other financial scandals occurred, the devastation that ensued for so many investors brought the public's attention to the lack of oversight of financial markets, and this compelled the nation to create stronger safeguards to prevent such scandals from occurring in the future.  Numerous new laws were passed and stricter standards were created to regulate financial markets and investments.  While speakers, academics, and professionals might have warned of these problems and discussed them for years previously, it was not until an actual large scale devastating scandal occurred that impacted thousands of people that action was seriously taken to correct the issue.  Thus, it is evident that while scandals are horrific and leave victims in their wake, they can serve to focus our attention on problems so that we can move towards a solution.  Sometimes the shock and horror of a situation is necessary in order to get society's attention so that we can act together, cooperatively, to improve conditions and to fix what has been broken.  Together, we can move towards progress.
A2CHDWKAYZ3P3E	essay1	There are many signs that people are already forgetting how to think for themselves. Every day you can witness so many people relying on their phones or other technological devices to do things as simple as basic multiplication or to spell elementary-tiered words that should be instilled in their heads by now. Also, people tend to now rely on the advice, reviews, and outlooks of others via social media, messaging boards, or groups before making any decisions; whether they be personal decisions, purchasing decisions, etc. I totally agree that as time goes on more and more people are relying on technology to think for them instead of using their own brains to do the thinking.
A2CHDWKAYZ3P3E	essay2	"Studying major cities would in no way help someone to better understand the most important characteristics of society. In fact, if someone was to use a geographical location to understand the important characteristics of society then they would also need to study rural cities and little towns/boroughs to incorporate those places into the data they're trying to use to support this incorrect statement. To understand society I believe that one must take into account all of society and what makes everyone ""tick"", or move. One would need to analyze controls in many different situations to make the given statement be valid and/or correct."
A2CHDWKAYZ3P3E	essay3	Scandals are in fact useless, in terms of having any importance or relevance to anything that should be getting attention. I see nothing positive coming from the attention that a scandal can bring. A speaker or reformer could much better draw attention to problems in a positive way, instead of having to conduct a scandal just for attention. Scandals usually damage a person or companies image and in almost all case will never get anything other than negative attention. Not to say that negative attention can't be good attention, but in the case of a scandal, I'm sure someone's image is more likely to be tarnished than boost by the attention.
A2CNNBX9KLQUQJ	essay1	I agree that as people rely more on technology to solve problems, their ability to think for themselves deteriorates. I have noticed several people who often like to use a GPS mapping system to find a particular location. They depend on these systems for direction not realizing that they may not be as up to date as they thing, especially in rural areas. When they reach a certain point where a street name is wrong or they hit a re routing of the street, they are lost and don't quite know what to do. I've seen some drive up and down a street looking for the correct name or listening to their system when all they had to do was drive a little further down the route to find what they needed. For this reason I agree with the statement above as it also happens in other areas of technology as well.
A2CNNBX9KLQUQJ	essay2	I diagree with the statement that in order to understand the most important charachteristics of a society, one must study it's major cities. While some major cities have areas where this is true, primarily downtown areas, most are becoming run down ghost towns on the outskirts and in horrific shape in the inner cities where people are forgotten. I believe we need to look at rural town to find what is asked. Many of these rural cities are growing slowly as people move away from the decline of our major cities and help these areas in groth. At one time the statement above was true but once whe hit the 1980's the most important charactteristics are nothing more than how not to have any form of society in our major cities.
A2CNNBX9KLQUQJ	essay3	I disagree that scandals are useful to focus our attention on problems in ways no speaker or reformer ever could. Scandals are gossip and distract from the big picture. They are only good for solidifying one's opposing view towards a person or subject. The time that gets wasted, and in many cases tax dollars, would be far better used elsewhere. Taking into account the current Trump adult Star scandal that occurred years ago with a recent payoff before the election, it draws away from work that should be done for the country. Truth be told they all did things like this and again it takes away from their job and in Trumps case is a personal matter he needs to handle with family.
A2CP7U2TMVJUX2	essay1	I disagree with this premise since humans rely on technology to complete task not think for them. Typically when a person types something on the internet they are searching for that information themselves. If someone could not think for themselves and had something such as brain damage, then they wouldn't be able to use the technology to that degree anyway. The only aspects that technology solves problems for us are within mathematical equations or automatic transactions. Technology will be a resource that helps humanity transcend human limitations not limit them.
A2CP7U2TMVJUX2	essay2	It is true that to understand ones society, one would need to study its major cities. The primary reason is that is where most of that country's population lives. What types Transportation, housing, etc may change throughout which areas people live, but the holidays, food, type of work, goals should be the same. Getting the statistics on a majority of a population will help understand most the characteristics displayed within that country rather than if you tried understanding a country side city to represent that country.
A2CP7U2TMVJUX2	essay3	Scandals bring attention to issues that had less relevance to them prior. An example of this today is school shootings within the United States. We used to only look at these shootings as extreme cases within society, but within the last decade or so that has changed. The more frequent a scandal or event happens the more the public will focus on it until a politician or someone will be forced to make change. It is more difficult to make change when fewer people are knowledgeable on something.
A2CT57W84KXX25	essay1	I totally agree with this, Humans has gotten to the point where they have to have their phone for everything. Technology has advanced so much That humans do not have to do anything. we have robots that vaccum the floor. They are producing self driving vehicles so pretty soon humans will not even have to drive. As far as smart phones there is an app for everything.
A2CT57W84KXX25	essay2	I do not agree with this, Major cities has nothing to do with society at all. There is small towns that has characteristics. I think one should research the history of any society they want to learn about.There is small cities that has characteristics . So it being a major city really has nothing to do with it
A2CT57W84KXX25	essay3	I agree. I mean look at the scandal with bill clinton or even hilary clinton. We would have never known anything about that if it was not for the scandal that broke out and took over and became public. Which was important and very helpful considering he was our president and she ran for president. That could have been a bad suituation if it was not for the scandals that broke out about them.
A2DHFZAZ66A5OR	essay1	I am feeling in accordance with this statement. People will find the easiest way to achieve the results that they desire. Now this is not always a bad thing. Sometimes this can save a person time completing a task, which in turn means that will give them more time to do another task. However completing a task does not always equate to learning from it. And so, while the problems or tasks that they are hoping to overcome may indeed be conquered, the person may still not have learned anything from it, due to the fact that the person has not really put much thought into it in the first place.
A2DHFZAZ66A5OR	essay2	"I am not in agreement with this one. For instance, I have done a lot of traveling in my life so far. Often this has brought me to new and different places. Much different than the society in which I was raised. And much of the time I found that the most I learned about the people of any particular region was when I visited the smaller villages. I find that people there tend to behave more naturally. They are not as influenced by outside stimuli, nor as interested in ""keeping up with the Jones's"". They tend to just be themselves. And I feel we learn and understand more of what those people are actually about than of the people who live in the big cities."
A2DHFZAZ66A5OR	essay3	I disagree with this. The reason is that scandals often tend to also get mired in a lot of hearsay. With the use of social media at an all time high and continuing to grow, it doesn't take much to get a large number of people to believe something that may not have a grain of truth to it. I think most people are perfectly capable of focusing their attention on problems without the need for scandals. I know some people tend to like the sensationalism that often goes along with a scandal. but this isn't helping to solve the real problem, it's more of a form of entertainment for some people.
A2E3TO92MCQ9XU	essay1	The history of humanity has been one of increasing technological sophistication, from our cave dwelling ancestors, to feudal peasantry, to the modern milieu. Through all this there has been no evidence of the ability of humans to think for themselves deteriorating. Moreover, the technology, even as it solves problems, creates new opportunities and unexpected complexities. These are challenges that our forefathers never had to contend with. Therefore, it is necessary for the current generation to think for themselves, to solve these challenges. As technology gets ever more sophisticated, this trend will only continue.
A2E3TO92MCQ9XU	essay2	A society is defined by the interaction of the human population making up that society. Cities are the greatest concentration of those human populations. There they will interact with each other more frequently than they would in rural settings. While only studying major cities presents us with an incomplete picture of the society, it is nevertheless logical to pay greater attention to these gathering points of humanity where the greatest amount of social interaction is taking place. It’s in these contexts where a society’s characteristics are made most clear.
A2E3TO92MCQ9XU	essay3	People nowadays have short attention spans. There’s so much competing for our attention and focus that it’s easy to shut out a speaker trying to spread a reforming message. In this context scandals are one of the more effective and convenient tools for focusing the attention of people. A good scandal, in this context, is both salacious and easily understood. Even if people can’t elaborate on the fine details, they can nevertheless grasp the salient points of a scandal. That ease, combined with the inherent interest generated by the nature of a scandal, makes it particularly good as a focal point for society’s attention.
A2E5PZUD6W4OA1	essay1	I agree with this statement. Biologically people want instant gratification and with the availability of technology they skip the thinking process and instead are programmed to use certain technologies for the solution. An example would be spell checks, before we had to go through the process of sounding out the word and then seeing if it made sense. Now we skip the process entirely and it removes the learning process. This will slowly create a generation that is dependent on technology. As technology advances the creators will be looked at as elite intellectuals and the generation will be demoralized to think for themselves and to accept technocracy.
A2E5PZUD6W4OA1	essay2	Major cities are a good way of learning about the melting pot of society. In a major city you can find rich, poor and even middle class together each with thier own motive. The city could be divided into certain regions for certain groups and you can understand how each group interacts with one another and thier position in the society. A major city is the core of the society and it will show you the norms and its status in the world.
A2E5PZUD6W4OA1	essay3	I agree scandals allow masses to be involve and can swing a trend in a completely opposite position. Scandals are usually very taboo and are purely negative which draws attention and because of the negative subject those who are rather misinformed will collectively side against the perpetrator of the negative issue. After being aroused by the scandal story some will seek more information and eventually linking new stories together. This allows a issue to state relevant way after the scandal because there isn't a resolution.
A2EA2PN47ZWILX	essay1	I do not believe that technology will make humans unable to solve problems.  While they may rely more heavily upon technology to do simple tasks, humans will still need to think for themselves on many other levels.  To interact with others you will still require thought.  I don't believe this assumption that people will allow technology to do all of their thinking as technology will not be able to provide one with common sense, something that most people rely upon.  It will make things nicer and allow meaningless tasks to be completed, but it will not allow for one to stop thinking altogether.
A2EA2PN47ZWILX	essay2	I do not agree that belief that the most important characteristics of a society are solely found in major cities.  While it is true major cities are melting pots and contain people from all walks of life, you cannot discard those that live in more rural areas.  If one wants to get a more accurate view into important characteristics of a society, they really need to look at both the major cities along with more rural areas as the two one will find can be vastly different in their own unique ways.  One simply cannot take a look at one without the other, to make this assumption would be absurd.
A2EA2PN47ZWILX	essay3	While it is true that scandals do tend to gain more attention and draw people's attention to facts and ideas far more easily than listening to a speaker, I do not believe that it is always this way.  Scandal tends to lead to very negative views.  If a speaker is trying to draw focus to something in a more positive manner, this most likely will not be done via a scandal.  An example of what would be necessary to change my view would be to showcase one example of a time a scandal was seen in a positive light and that people were able to see clearly enough to see be attentive and see more than just the negativity the scandal provided.
A2EPBSY0VPI38S	essay1	I believe technology will not decrease human ability to think. I argue that technology will change the way humans think. It will simply change our method of thinking. Technology will open up how we see and view the world. It will encourage us to explore aspects of the world that was limited. Technology gives us more time to research and seek answers to questions. Technology will encourage humans to develop more ways to do things in a more efficient way. Technology will never replace human thought.
A2EPBSY0VPI38S	essay2	I agree that understanding society requires us to look at a snapshot of society. However, research can not just focus on major cities. A focus on major cities only will exclude many types of people and will lead to a false representation of society. I believe in order to get a better picture of society's characteristics, researchers must use a tool that will involve those who live in small rural areas as well as major cities. This will allow researchers to identify more universal traits across a total population instead of focusing solely on those who dwell in urban areas.
A2EPBSY0VPI38S	essay3	Scandals are useful because it does force society to address the issue. For instance, the scandal with Harvey Weinstein forced Hollywood to look at how women have been abused and mistreated in that industry for years. Hollywood was forced to see that the issue was real and changes needed to be made. I believe that Hollywood would still be in denial if the Weinstein scandal did not happen. Now, an industry is changing and women issues are being recognized as real problems. Scandal is ugly but it allows us to see the truth and leads to change in society.
A2FL477TMKC91L	essay1	I wholeheartedly agree: the more we rely on technology, the less we can think for ourselves. I immediately think of how texting has changed the way we use the English language. As an educator, I have seen both the steady decline in students' ability to use grammar properly and an inability to go from text-speak to communicating in a more appropriate, formal way. Also, before we had all this tech to fascilitate communication, students had to figure out problems on their own. Now, they don't both to engage their problem-solving skills; the minute something problematic or confusing happens, they shoot off an email and wait for someone else to fix the issue.
A2FL477TMKC91L	essay2	I agree with this to some extent: cities are where you are going to find the highest concentration of people. If you are interested in how humans have had to learn to interact with each other in such a way that allows them to live so close together, then cities are the way to go. But to truely understand a society, it would be scientifically biased to only look at one part of the population. To understand a society you have to look at every part of it. Only studying cities would bias results. One should also include suburban and rural populations to gain a complete picture of societal characteristics.
A2FL477TMKC91L	essay3	"I completely disagree - scandals focus our attention on problems, yes, but generally not on problems that affect society as a whole. Scandals, in our society, generally are about something ""juicy"", something sexual (e.g., the Bill Clinton impeachment scandal). Scandals are a diversion from real societal issues. We rarely see scandals that would focus our attention to the environment, to homelessness, to immigration reform, etc. We're not interested in scandals that might be about something important, because those scandals aren't sexy, they don't get splashed across the news. In fact, scandals tend to take away from our attention of important matters: just look at everything Trump has done - it's all scandal."
A2FLOH4DM8A4ZS	essay1	I think humans, at least many Americans, are already losing their ability to think for themselves, even without technology.  Then again, technology is an easy way to spread ideas so its definitely assisting with that.  A lot of people seem to really just follow what the group does, especially on the left of the political spectrum, so why think for yourself when you can just follow what the group does?  As far as technology in general, all of us become more reliant on it by the day, and while it definitely helps make lives easier, it also becomes a crutch that we've grown to rely on for almost anything now.  Some people are quite lost without their electronic devices to keep them up to speed with the world around them.
A2FLOH4DM8A4ZS	essay2	"I don't really have a big opinion on this one.  I don't see myself as an ambassador for any particular town, not even my own, nor do I expect to find the answer to the ""most important characteristics"" of a society.  I don't really know what they are, so I don't know how I'd understand them either.  For someone like me, i'd say I would not be able to understand the most important characteristics.  Every city is run differently, say take New York City for example, then go to most any city in California right now as they harbor illegals in their towns.  I think California is pretty major and yet its gone completely downhill and it does not have the best interests or positive characteristics for a good society, that's for sure, especially with how they illegally harbor people."
A2FLOH4DM8A4ZS	essay3	"I disagree because I don't give any care about scandals.  Scandals are just an excuse to be nosy in someone's personal life and spread their private information outwards, usually in a negative fashion for points.  These points would either be for sharing the information or whatever newspaper or website you're posting these in for more views.  Petty things like this is some of the worst of humanity that just seems to be widely acceptable.  I don't know what you mean by ""in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could"".  A scandal has to be reported by someone, and a ""speaker"" can do just that, same as any reformer.  Therefore, what exactly is the difference?  This isn't is not particularly clear."
A2FLZP3C6U67JY	essay1	I think human thinking and ingenuity is intuitive and instinctive.  It is the one trait that distinguishes us from animals.  I don't believe any amount of technology, no matter how much and how long we rely on it, will diminish our capacity for reasoning.  If anything, it may enhance our abilities.  Throughout history, humans have always created technologies that lessen effort and it only increases our ability to think.  It allows more time and freedom to think about more complex and difficult problems.  So if we think about it this way, we can consider technology a catalyst for independent thinking rather than a hindrance.
A2FLZP3C6U67JY	essay2	I don't believe it is necessary to study major cities to understand the important characteristics of a society. In fact, looking a major metropolitan areas can confuse and muddle one's understanding.  Major cities often have their own distinct cultures and themes that are very different from the rest of a society.  I believe to best get a sense for what a society is like it would be more useful to study small cities.  These cities would be more likely to posses the inherent characteristics of a society and would allow one to discover a truer sense of what makes a culture.
A2FLZP3C6U67JY	essay3	Scandals are not useful in most any sense.  They are often overblown and connect with the darker side of humanity.  Scandals are useful to those in power to distract the rest of us from more important issues.  They present opportunities to cloak intentions allow nefarious actors to make moves in the shadows.  Scandals also tend to focus on the more outrageous aspects of a problem. They are often associated with outliers and not the most central issue, which leaves people pointing fingers in the wrong direction. We would all be better off if we looked past the scandal to see what is really going on behind the scenes.
A2FYQIZWV2UJHS	essay1	I believe that as people rely more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely be enhanced. Everyday, we learn more ways to complete a task. With every new invention we make, a new idea of thinking arises. We will always have to figure out ways to make technology better. Technology can never take over our ways of thinking. I support that technology advances will make it easier for humans to come up with more ideas.
A2FYQIZWV2UJHS	essay2	I believe that in order to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities. Each city across the United States has its own special trademark. My city is known for its beer and we have a very relaxed population in this town. People in California have surf boarders and more of a rich population there. Each city has its own background and certain characteristics that become us.
A2FYQIZWV2UJHS	essay3	Scandals are not useful. They can bring harm and devastation wherever they go. There are other problems in the world that deserve and need our attention. Poverty its one. Why focus on minor scandal issues. This actually makes us less likely to think. We just shut down our brains and move on.
A2GAQZAZWV01PU	essay1	I agree with this statement to a certain extent. We do not need technology as humans however it does make things much easier for us. Looking more into the situation though shows that we have become less curious as humans and thus we do not think as much for ourselves. This creates an interesting dilemma that we must assess. We can either accept this fact and continue on the current trend or we can actually become self-sufficient and do things for ourselves again. If we keep this up well we may become severely dependent on technology however we will be able to do things that we normally do not do. If we do something about it, technology will suffer to a certain point but at least we will be able to do without. I stand on the side of doing something about it as this way if something ever bad was to happen, we can surely fend for ourselves.
A2GAQZAZWV01PU	essay2	Society is separated by various social norms and within those social norms you will find that they are typically in certain cities. If we were to look at major cities we would find that there is a certain percentage of a various group that dominates that city as a whole. If we was to find that same group in other city, we would find that there is a different dominating group. This is what culture is all about, various groups gravitate towards the other groups that they wish to mingle with. It also shows that the important characteristics of society are separated by the groups. If we were to mix the groups together, well we would have a very nasty melting pot.
A2GAQZAZWV01PU	essay3	I disagree with this statement. I say this because scandals are people that try to ride the current topics to benefit only them. Scandals are also the type of people that would hurt other people if they could. A purpose of a scandal is to get to the top f something or to get as much money as possible. I personally would not trust these people due to the nature. I mean surely you as the reader gets the occasional scam phone call saying that you won a cruise. Well that guy telling you that is a scandal as well.
A2GB0RI43KU4Z	essay1	With more than one advance in technology, there has been an accompanying fear that the people who use it will find their own mental capacity suffering. The fear is compounded now considering just how advanced our technology has become. However, the fact of the matter is that technology simply allows the ways that humans think to evolve. Rather than focus on particular details of life that we can hand off to technology, humans can spend more time thinking about other issues that concern them. Beyond that, the way that implementation of technology occurs often involves a great deal of thought. We don't simply adopt new technology, instead considering how to incorporate it into our lives so that it serves us best. We also continue to develop these implementations, thinking all along in a way that's perhaps a bit more abstract than we were able to think before.
A2GB0RI43KU4Z	essay2	Cities are indeed a focal point of modern society. While they don't encompass every aspect of culture, they do tend to highlight the most significant trends and the most commonly held values. One cannot hope to understand a society without carefully examining the biggest building blocks of that society -- the things that draw so many people to the city, the ways the population accommodate needs and the differences involved in such a life as compared to more rural life, and the very fact that the city is such an attraction to such a wide variety of people. It's a society at-large condensed into a smaller scale within those city boundaries. Whatever the popula
A2GB0RI43KU4Z	essay3	While a great mind may identify a dangerous trend and speak about it at great length, nothing really focuses the attention on such problems as a scandal. The one who identifies the problem early is seen to be speaking of theory or of hypothetical situations. They are pessimists or muckrakers, unable to kindle much of an interest in their warnings because of how tenuous the connection to reality seems to most other people. However, once a scandal comes to light and shows the reality of what the reformer may have preached about for years, everyone can plainly see the dangers and harms to society that were theoretical before. It's unfortunate that such things must arise to enable us to notice the stains we need to scrub, but one cannot question the efficacy of the bright light shown on the stains compared to the murmurs of someone warning that there might be some dirt somewhere. The problems then demand our attention, where we could previously easily ignore the speaker.
A2GG7HIO2OIXUR	essay1	"I think the statement above is a bit too vague to agree or disagree with.  While I do think that people will retain less information that they learn by reading online, I don't think this necessarily means that people will not be able to think for themselves anymore.  We will still have the ability to reason and come up with our own conclusions to problems and ideas.  Where I think the problem will come in is the retaining and learning of information.  People don't need to remember spelling anymore, thanks to autocorrect; they don't need to remember facts because you can search the information with the tap of a finger; we carry all the knowledge of everything in our pockets every day, so learning is not as important anymore.  Remember when our teachers use to make us write out math, and they would say ""You won't always have a calculator on you!""?  Well, we DO have calculators on us.  So, in terms of learning, yes I think technology will have a dramatic impact on that, but when it comes to people's ability to think in general, if anything I think technology will increase that by putting so much information in front of us at all times, sparking our curiosity."
A2GG7HIO2OIXUR	essay2	I disagree with the statement above.  In order to understand the most important aspects of urban society, yes you should study cities, but all of society is not comprised of cities.  Societies are all different and they are all based on different environments, different governments, different cultures, and different people. If anything, you are learning more about the effects of people living in very close quarters, rather than learning about society itself.  You must incorporate all aspects of society, the young, the old, the rural, and the urban, in order to get a clear picture of it as a whole.
A2GG7HIO2OIXUR	essay3	I can only agree with the above statement to a certain extent.  While I do believe that scandals are important because they bright to light issues that a person would not address themselves, I also think that the context and use of the scandal is important.  If the scandal is relevant, in terms of morality or the person's position, then it should absolutely be addressed.  On the flip side, addressing trivial or unimportant or irrelevant issues can be detrimental because not only will it cast the person in a certain light over things that don't matter, but it can also take away from the true issues by causing a distraction.  People can tend to focus too much on the negative, scandalous side of things and this can cause them to become sidetracked and miss the big picture.
A2HA52MJN7CTLM	essay1	I agree with this statement.  Humans have lost common sense because of technology.  We now rely on the internet to tell us everything instead of searching for those answers on our own.  We live in a world of instant gratification and it isn't reality.  I think if people lost that technology many would not know how to survive.  We have lost touch with our roots.
A2HA52MJN7CTLM	essay2	I agree to a certain extent, however I think we need to study more than this.  Studying the major cities helps but to really understand the important characteristics we need to study the rural areas as well.  People in the cities couldn't survive without farmers and people who gather other resources in the rural areas of the world.  We need a larger view of things to really understand society as a whole.  Without one you can't have the other.
A2HA52MJN7CTLM	essay3	I disagree with this claim.  I think scandals distract us from the real problems.  We are to focused on which celebrity is dating who then we are on what our government is doing.  We need to focus more on the things that matter, not the scandals.  There are to many thing distracting us from reality to know what is true and what is not.
A2HC9549CZAKNN	essay1	The argument that the ability of humans to think for themselves will deteriorate due to technology is very valid. Cognitive ability is very much dependent on the continued use of one's facilities, and many forms of technology have alleviated the need for humans to think for themselves. For instance, the presence of calculators on every person's cell phone has negated the need for people to compute simple tip amount and percentages. As people rely more on technology and do not use their minds to conduct these, they will deteriorate more.  A further issue is that people spend more time in activities that require little thought and concentration. For instance, they will chat or play a simple game on the computer instead of interacting with others. They will conduct fewer activities in which they actually use their mind, which can promote the abilities to think for themselves.  As people use more and more technology for even the most basic of activities, they will lose the desire, and subsequently the ability to make decisions for themselves across a broad range of areas.
A2HC9549CZAKNN	essay2	The study of major cities is important in determining the characteristics of a society, and yet it will not give a complete picture. It is true that cities are reflective in many ways of a culture. There are many people aggregated in a small area, which can provide researchers with many individuals in which to study. Yet cities as a whole have their own unique set of characteristics, which is distinctive from other areas. The suburbs and rural areas of a society possess many characteristics of their own, which can give great insight into a society. Thus a research could not truly discover all of the most important characteristics of a city without examining those as well.  Thus it is important to look at cities when examining a society, but it is equally important to consider other areas when forming a comprehensive view of a society. Also, in certain cases, there are extenuating circumstances that will make a city different. For instance, Pyongyang is hardly representative of North Korea as a whole, yet it would be an important location in which to research the society. By looking at all aspects of the society, one can gain true insight into its characteristics.
A2HC9549CZAKNN	essay3	Scandals can provide a powerful platform for problems, which may have otherwise remained shrouded in secret. Oftentimes, there are practices or issues that are known, and yet no one truly steps up to address them. A scandal can force these issues into the open, providing a forum for the world to see.   Scandals grip people, laying bare the truth that people ignore as often as they hide. They make it impossible not to recognize wrongs, or issues, which deserve the scrutiny the scandal will now assure. They bring attention to some of the world's greatest problems, and subsequently reform, which can be powerful and highly beneficial.   Some may argue that speakers and reforms are powerful, as well, and of course this is true. Yet it is difficult to match the pure publicity a scandal can attract across so many people. With a scandal, the attention is granted with or without conscious desire or purposeful intent, making it inherently more poignant and powerful.
A2IKPU88PDQTMF	essay1	I think AI is the future of technology. As AI gets more advanced, humans will be needed less and less to think of complex solutions to problems because AI will be able to do it for us. Humans will deteriorate towards an existence when AI controls the major means of difficulty in their life. Humans will have a lower education attaintment due to AI learning. Humans may actually devolve in intelligence over time due to the lack of necessity in using brain power.
A2IKPU88PDQTMF	essay2	I think in studying the major cities, you can see what is important in society. The capital building is at the center of most major cities, and they show that it is important in society to have a place of law and order. If you look at major cities, there are a lot of educational institutions which also show how much importance is placed in educating society. Sports institutions are probably third in its prominence in major cities. It shows society values the tribal nature of sports in keeping society entertained and distracted.
A2IKPU88PDQTMF	essay3	I don't think scandals are useful for focusing our attention on problems. In fact, I think scandals can be away of drawing society's attention away from the issues that matter the most. If you look at Trump in the White House, there are so many issues that need to be brought to attention. However, what are the issues that often get attention from Trump in the media? It is often is blasphemous tweets that he uses as sound off board for his frustrations. Instead of keeping focusing on the issues that this administration is really doing to hurt America, we are side tracked by his many scandals.
A2J2P9JE374XCM	essay1	I highly agree with this. Children are not being taught cursive in school, because people don't write anymore. The schools are switching to digital clocks, because children don't know how to tell time on an analog clock. We have computers to do everything for us. Calculators to do math. There is no need to remember phone numbers anymore, because our cell phones to that for as as well.
A2J2P9JE374XCM	essay2	I don't agree with that. There are so many different cities in the USA, and they each have their own characteristics. The North is completely different from the south and the east is very different from the west coast. The differences are vast. There is no way to base one society by the major cities in this country.
A2J2P9JE374XCM	essay3	I think scandals take our attention off of the important things that are going on. People get so caught up in the gossip, that major issues get swept aside. I also think some people start scandals to cover up what they are doing, so people don't notice. Take Hillary Clinton, she is still trying to get the heat off of her, by still complaining about President Trump.
A2JZP4AZI1RTG4	essay1	I disagree with that premise because humans use technology as tools. Tools are there to help people but a tool is just that, a tool. How to use the tool, when the best time to use a tool, the expertise to use a tool, etc, etc, are all important aspects that people tend to overlook. What really matters is the person behind the tool. They are the ones who truly matter and their ability to think for themselves will not deteriorate for that.
A2JZP4AZI1RTG4	essay2	I agree and disagree with that premise. I think we need to look at all of the parts of a society, big and small, in order to draw the important characteristics of that society. Not everyone lives in major cities and not every important thing happens in a major city. For example, if you looked at the U.S. solely by looking at cities like Los Angeles and New York, you would get a very poor painting of what the U.S. is really like when you ignore the small towns that are also a big part of a country's characteristics.
A2JZP4AZI1RTG4	essay3	I agree and disagree with that. It really depends on what kind of scandal we're talking about. If it's a scandal like the Mercedes emissions scandal or the Equifax scandal, then yes I do believe they are very useful because they shine a spotlight on something that normally wouldn't. When we're talking about celebrity scandals, however, I feel that this is just popcorn for the masses with very little value. They're talked about a lot but have very little substance.
A2L22HZ50T83UK	essay1	I believe this statement is absolutely true. I have worked in retail and in any office environment and everyone is totally dependent on computers and technology. When our cash registered were down many of our staff could not use a calculator let alone pen and paper. In my office people cannot take short hand, they don't know how to format a letter. The HR staff cannot do the payroll manually so on two occasions a software issue left us all without pay for almost a week. More and more pen and paper is leaving schools and kids are being educated only on electronic devices which means the problem can only get worse. There is no need for kids to learn to think for themselves when a push of a button will do it for them and when they are being encouraged to only think logically and to learn to program rather than to think laterally and creatively. The fetish with STEM has discouraged free thinking.
A2L22HZ50T83UK	essay2	I don't agree with this. I think cities get too much coverage on the news and most TV shows are set there. I believe cities are the epicenter of art and culture especially youth culture. However, time and again people are then stumped when they see rural areas come out and change the predicted election result. The rural population is more spread out and therefore harder to capture but many people who end up in the cities are raised in rural areas. They bring those basic characteristics to the cities. I think rural areas can have ''silent'' movements that seem to come out of nowhere and city folk are stumped because they didn't realize the sheer number of people outside the cities who shared that viewpoint.  I think you must understand the rural population and their beliefs to understand a society.
A2L22HZ50T83UK	essay3	I believe scandals are necessary. Unfortunately as a society we have a tendency to hide reality and sweep it under a rug. We focus only on first impressions and externals and so much negativity is hidden. This allows problems in our society to fester and fester and get worse. When a scandal breaks it pulls back the rug and it allows other to come forward and share their story and admit this has happened to them too. It also allows people who have always wanted to support victims but couldn't of they wanted to keep their position in society to come out and say this is a problem. Ultimately the problem can no longer be ignored and it's not easy to sweep in under the carpet again. For example, the child abuse scandals in the Catholic church helped our society to accept child abuse in all religions, in the home, in schools etc.. and it gave victims a voice to say enough is enough.
A2LC2DS8OH7NCA	essay1	We are already seeing the effects of technology on people's ability to think. Two examples include memory and spatial awareness. For example, the use of GPS units and Google Maps has reduced people's awareness of their surroundings and their ability to read maps. We often see stories about drivers blindly following heir GPS instructions and getting lost or worse driving into danger. Our mobile phones now act as our external memories. Fewer people can remember phone numbers. No longer do we have to remember small tidbits of information to look up later. We can ask our voice assistants for help solving minor trivia, or access Wikipedia whenever we want. We don't have to puzzle out the solution to a question using logic when a host of internet resources are always available in our pockets.  We rely less on our own ability to perform math calculations with a phone in our pocket at all times.
A2LC2DS8OH7NCA	essay2	Cities are excellent laboratories for studying society. With a large number of residents, the sample sizes allow us to draw some conclusions about the society as a whole. Cities tend to draw people from rural and suburban areas and immigrants from around the world which provides an excellent cross-section of humanity. The ways in which people interact given their diverse backgrounds can offer insights into the workings of a society that you may not be able to discover in a rural or suburban area with their isolated monocultures.
A2LC2DS8OH7NCA	essay3	In laying bare a scandal, we can discover some of the inner workings of an organization that may not come to light through an outside observer. An outsider observer may not be aware of the procedures or culture inside the organization that let to a scandal. As the scandal unfolds, bits and pieces are revealed by the players involved  including ways in which the rules and customs of the organization were violated, sometimes in unexpected ways. Investigating a scandal and revealing these process weaknesses will offer opportunities to fix the issue and prevent similar future scandals. An investigation may open up those involved to formal punishment which are again not necessarily possible through the efforts of outside observer.
A2LT6KC1X51FVW	essay1	Technology, at its core, is simply the application of human ingenuity to creating products and services that help us function in our daily lives more effectively and in new domains. Technology has been advancing throughout the centuries. We have only gotten more intelligent as time has progressed, not less. While some may let certain things deteriorate due to technology, such as relying too heavily on spelling and grammar checkers, plenty of others use technology to help empower the decisions they make and enable them to operate in ways they were unable to previously (see: artificial intelligence, machine learning). As such, it is incorrect to think that technology will cause human ability to deteriorate. Surely, we're more than happy as a species to think any way we please, even in ways that defy the logic that technology often brings.
A2LT6KC1X51FVW	essay2	This holds partially true. It does not entail the whole story, though. Cities often take the form of an amalgamation a society. They are presented as a condensed form of the various micro-societies around them. However, with such compression, they also their ability to pick up nuances that are present in suburban and rural areas. This may given you a decent picture of a society, but there will be gaps. I suppose, perhaps, that this would cover the most important characteristics, then. Though, that remains arguable and is highly subjective.
A2LT6KC1X51FVW	essay3	Scandals focus our attention because they present a dramatic picture. They entice for the same reason gossip is so popular. A speaker could put together something much better prepared. However, this speaker wouldn't draw the same audience. In that way, scandals do provide some use. They must focus our attention on the problem in the correct way and with the ambition to better the situation, though. Without attending to the issue itself and merely paying attention to the scandal for its entertainment value, they provide little to no use.
A2LTGFMW5PUE01	essay1	I agree that as more people rely more on technology, the ability to think for themselves deteriorate. I base this on personal experience and by what I have witnessed. I lived through Hurricane Maria and the effects of the storm. Besides the fact that we did not have power, communications were down for more than 72 hours. As we were trying to survive the first chaotic days, I realized how much I relied on technology to give me information. There was so much that I did not know, and there was no way to find out inf
A2LTGFMW5PUE01	essay2	"I agree with this statement because there is a process in which cities transform. For a city to become major and successful, there had to be adequate planning from the people that live within the city. If one is to create a brand new city, then it is important to study bigger cities. I believe nothing in this life is ""original."" Everything comes from someone else's idea. Therefore, we should ""copy"" the same structure from other successful cities."
A2LTGFMW5PUE01	essay3	"I do not agree because scandals are usually based on gossip. Meaning, that most scandals have to deal with if someone did something that some may consider to be morally wrong. As a society, we tend to focus too much on scandals and the ""juicy"" details. Instead, we should be focusing on more important matters that could affect our society as a whole.  We need to set aside our differences and agree that what is morally wrong for one person, another person may not consider it to be wrong."
A2LVCS009DMEAT	essay1	In today's world people rely more on technology. No one goes to visit their relatives anymore, instead it's face time  or text messages. There are so many electronic devices to use nowadays. One can use Google, Siri or Alexa to search the internet or even turn on the television. People are getting lazy and and their health is declining because of the dependence on technology. The smartphone is really smart, also the smart tv. People don't do regular family activities anymore instead they are on their phone. Children carry their phone around the table when eating, they have no time to go for a walk. They stay
A2LVCS009DMEAT	essay2	One should study the major cities so it can be determine what is needed or acceptable for the cities. If there isn't enough hospitals or schools that should be considered. Businesses are also needed in order to provide work for the residents. It just be noted the amount of people living in the area and housing development.
A2LVCS009DMEAT	essay3	Without scandal no one would know how corrupt a person or business is. The scandal will let us see the depth of the problem and we could find a solution. If the person involved in the scandal is not worthy of the position, then he or she should be replaced. The scandal will make it known how much the problem can get out of hand.
A2M72F8KER9L71	essay1	The question of whether humans will likely think less for themselves because advances in technology allows them to do so is, in my opinion, easy to answer.  If we start with the assumption that humans will behave similarly as they have in the past to other advances in technology, whether it be machines or methods, there is likely to be a normally distributed response to the question.  Some humans will undoubtedly think less, just as they sit in their automated recliners and watch senseless television shows.  Some will think much more as they derive new ways to use the technology to advance human knowledge even further.  The belly of the curve will think just as much as they do now, only they will have the leisure to think about different things than they do now.
A2M72F8KER9L71	essay2	Major cities almost always form a synopsis of a society's major characteristics because they are both where the most technically advanced members of society usually are drawn to as well as where the most downtrodden and despair ridden members flock to.  Since the major cities tend to be locations where jobs are concentrated, at least regionally, within the society, these cities result in a dense population reflecting the societies highest and lowest achieving members with a large population of what we would term middle class members.  This clash of cultures and the density of the population causes problems that are unknown to less densely populated areas and the society's solution to these problems reveals a lot of information about the society's goals and dreams.
A2M72F8KER9L71	essay3	Scandals have been historically some of the most newsworthy and historically documented events in human history.  As old as civilization itself, they are fascinating to people of all walks of life and probably the main reason that they are so documented and historically significant.  People generally will spread word about scandals well before and more often than any other type of 'news', lending them more information flow than if one were paying people to spread news.  This fascination likely arises from a deep seated desire to take comfort in hearing of the problems of others because it can make one's own problems seem less significant by comparison.
A2ML4TEAJTDQD0	essay1	People will rely on this more and more. It is not about thinking or working but about being comfortable. This kind of action makes people lazy and in turn can cause us harm. Accidents and injuries happen because we will depend on technology to do things for us we previously did ourselves and didn't think twice to do anyway. Humans will be able to think for themselves but it will only be on a very shallow mundane level and after that it will be to difficult to maintain anything at all.
A2ML4TEAJTDQD0	essay2	There is something to be learned of the dynamic of people in a city. It's groups, it's groups in a certain place, groups in a certain area. How people change in certain places or groups. There are many divisions and sub divisions in a city depending on how people behave and react to one another. A very complex and diverse way to study varying characteristics of a society or societies in a city.
A2ML4TEAJTDQD0	essay3	Scandals are the spice of a story. A simple diversion from important matters. A certain type of person likes this in comparison to real matters. I believe it allows people to feel something towards something that has very little value of importance. It is a rumor mill for stories of people who are untouchable. It is entertainment and nothing more.
A2MQGU4NZZ8V0H	essay1	I would disagree. A person is responsible for educating themself. Technology can be used as an aid to do tasks we don't really want to do or aid us in things. Our collective ability to think for ourselves though is our own doing. I think if children aern't taught critical thinking skills at a early age this would effects their abilities. Technology in and of itself can help or hurt ones ability depending on how they use it. After a certain age this responsibility would fall on the individual.
A2MQGU4NZZ8V0H	essay2	I think major cities is only a small part of understanding society. If you focus on things like that you will miss out on the reality which is people in general, no matter where they live. If you study people and humanity it goes a long way to understanding society even if they are a remote group of people with no infrastructure.  Peoples lives, religion, education and all the other things that make up who we are and become tend to give clues to who we are as a society through out all of humanity.
A2MQGU4NZZ8V0H	essay3	I think scandals tend to give people a place to focus their anger. The focus their anger on an individual they don't like whether or not they have actually done anything. It tends to devastate society more than anything. They don't focus on the problems they actually have. They don't work their way through life trying to improve themself. They just learn that criticizing other people makes them feel better about themself. Having lots of scandals rewards this. It becomes who they are and they hurt other people in their day to day lives because this type of critical behavior has been rewarded.
A2MW2KLUNJ5SF8	essay1	I think there is some truth to the argument that the more we rely on technology the ability to think for ourselves will deteriorate.  You can see this happening a bit already.  All of these false and fake stories that come about on social media.  People just take these stories at their word and don't research them for themselves.  They will like and share these stories even though they are fake and aren't telling the whole truth.  They don't take a moment to think for themselves and wonder about the validity of these statements.  With the rate that social media is taking over our time and lives this is just going to get worse.  We used to have to do things and learn for ourselves.  Make mistakes and learn from them.  Now everything is just a phone call away.  We can just ha
A2MW2KLUNJ5SF8	essay2	I don't think that this is entirely true.  Sure there are a lot of things you can learn by studying the major cities, but there are a lot of people that don't live in major cities.  You can't learn about farming in major cities which is highly important in our society.  Studying major cities and the people within them won't let you learn about the smaller towns with character or the people living out in the country with their own characteristics also.  These people make up just as much of the fabric of our society as the people living within the major cities.  So while it is true that you do need to study the major cities it only gives you part of the picture in regards to a society as a whole.
A2MW2KLUNJ5SF8	essay3	I think that this is a very good and valid point.  With technology and social media the way it is word of mouth gets around fast.  As a society we seem to enjoy watching and hearing about scandals, along with adding our two cents to the situation.  If you look at the Twitter and facebook feeds there is a lot of information regarding scandals where as you don't see a lot about speakers or what they are trying to say.  This just doesn't hold our attention and grab our interest the way that scandals do.  We are so invested in celebrities and their lives that what they say and do becomes national news on a daily basis it seems.  Because they do grab our attention so passionately and so often it does make us see these problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.
A2MZYC2OHHM76X	essay1	I disagree with this statement.  The ability to use technology will allow humans to think more freely.  The access to correct information is unlike anything we have ever seen before.  Instead of not knowing something you can literally pull out your phone and in 10 seconds learn everything you need to know.  This ability gives humans a greater opportunity to learn truths and make better judgments.   Humans will also still have to have the ability to think of the questions they need to be answered.
A2MZYC2OHHM76X	essay2	I half agree and disagree with this.  Just look at present day America and the 2016 Presidental election.  Donald Trump lost almost every major city to Hillary Clinton.  Major cities do have a more diverse and better educated populous.  This does not reflect the society as a whole.  This just reflects the technological advances of the society.  A society is diverse and cannot be figured out with such a small sample size of just large cities.
A2MZYC2OHHM76X	essay3	Scandals if anything takes the focus away from problems.  Again, look at the current President of the United States Donald Trump.  Mr. Trump is involved in many ongoing scandals.  The USA has major problems like Flint, Michigan still not having suitable drinking water for it's citizens.  Instead of talking about something like that the whole country is more concerned with a porn star that he had sex with.  While the porn star case is becoming a very big deal, due to her attorney and the information he is finding out.  The whole thing has distracted people.  Scandals are usually entertaining and real problems are not entertaining.  People would rather focus on something they find entertaining than deal with a real issue.
A2NZ7RMSBXESNI	essay1	In some ways this statement is true. Many people don't know how to do simple math like how to multiply or divide even the simple numbers. They rely on their calculators to do this. Not using your brain to do simple things will most likely result in a person not being able to think quickly in certain circumstances. Your brain is like a muscle it needs to be exercised - use it or lose it.
A2NZ7RMSBXESNI	essay2	I agree with this statement. Most large cities are a microcosm of the nation's society. You will most certainly get a broad spectrum of the people that live in the country by analyzing the people that live in a large city. You need to see and listen to the people that  reside in the city to see who they are and what type of lives they live. Small towns will most likely be more homogeneous compared to large cities.
A2NZ7RMSBXESNI	essay3	I agree because the spotlight shinning on a scandal can reveal many things. People will learn so much more when they are interested in the topic. Scandals seem to peak people's interest especially if the scandal is salacious. People seem to be more interested in a subject if there is some sort of scandal that surrounds it too. There is nothing like a  good scandal to capture one's attention and the public's too.
A2OFN0A5CPLH57	essay1	I believe that it is true to some extent that because people are using technology more and more to solve problems, their ability to think for themselves will deteriorate.  The fist example that springs to my mind is the use of a calculator.  Many people have a cell phone which have calculators on them.  As a result, people may not decide to do mental math and use their calculator instead.  Another example I can think of is a person who works in a math related field.  Although a person may learn the math in college, when working a real job, they may use several computer programs that actually carry out the math for them and as a result, those people tend to forget how to perform all of the math that they learned in college.  People will rely on technology more and thus they will use their brain power less.
A2OFN0A5CPLH57	essay2	I don't think that one needs to study the major cities of a society to understand the most important characteristics of society.  I think that even small cities will have important characteristics of society.  There may be subtle differences in the way of life between a person who has spent their entire life in a small city compared to one who grew up in a major city.  Yet, I believe that people everywhere are basically the same.  They want to have a life where they have the things they need in order to survive.  I also think that smaller cities in a country, such as the US, still share the important characteristics of the US society.  People all over the US celebrate national holidays, such as the 4th of July.  It doesn't matter where you are located.  I think that one should study both major and smaller cities to really get a good understanding of a society.
A2OFN0A5CPLH57	essay3	Scandals are indeed useful in focusing our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.  A scandal straight out shows that there is a problem and brings to light what others may have never noticed.  When a scandal is uncovered, many people learn facts about things they may not have otherwise learned.  Take for example the scandal about all of the personal information the government had been collecting about the people.  When these scandals are discovered, people realize that there is a major problem and then people start to think deeper about other aspects.  I think that scandals uncover hidden truths about problems in society.
A2ONILC0LZKG6Y	essay1	"I agree to a degree, but with several qualifications. First, as to why I agree. From my own personal experience, relying on computers and other technology has led to the deterioration of my math skills as well as my memory for such things as phone numbers, dates, and appointments. I find myself using calculators for all but the simplest math problems, and have forgotten nearly all the advanced math I took. And I cannot seem to remember appointments I made the day before, unless they are entered into my calendar phone. As to other issues, that seems to stem more from how technology is used to select and present information to us. So we are still using our judgment, but the information we use to make that judgment may not be as wide or carefully chosen as in the past. The prime example of this is social media and how bias, fake news, and misleading information is presented to readers, partially through self-selection and partially based on marketing and other ""impure"" motivations. But people can still choose to avoid these things, they just have to choose to do so."
A2ONILC0LZKG6Y	essay2	I agree, primarily because nearly all of the values, habits, traditions, interests, and other characteristics in society can be found, to one degree or another, in major cities. This is in part because (at least in the US) many immigrants tend to end up in cities, and so you get a much wider view of a culture as a whole if you see not just the longer time participants of the society, but also how new members are integrated. Also, again in the US, rural and small town populations are decreasing as young people move to larger cities. They bring with them many of the characteristics of their previous lives, but also integrate with the long time city residents. In short, cities are a microcosm of a society as a whole. Of course, it may be possible for the opposite to be true in some societies. In that case, you can also learn a lot about the society by learning while those city residents don't leave the city.
A2ONILC0LZKG6Y	essay3	"I agree, but with major caveats. Scandals, and more importantly the large number of people who love them and the business that has grown up around catering to those people, do bring a lot of attention to topics and people that may not have been seen before. And it motivates people to dig deeper into a topis/person and not make assumptions, or take things at face value. Historically, many thing have been discovered (specifically in politics) because of scandalous behavior by individuals. But scandals can equally be used to deflect attention from other, maybe even more important topics. Hence the phrase ""wag the dog"" where information is used to manipulate the attention of the public as the people in power wish. Scandals also whip up emotion, sometimes to a causes' benefit, but sometimes in a way that makes rational, useful, action unlikely. People might also say that scandals dig into personal, private lives too often without useful cause."
A2P53AN2M8IWFP	essay1	People's critical thinking skills are deteriorating and will continue to degrade until mankind is useless. As people become more and more reliant on technology to think, their mental faculties will decline. We have already seen attention spans drop, people driving their cars mindlessly while staring at their phones. The brain is a muscle and the availability of a constant distraction means that people no longer use their brains. As interactive technology increase, the brain power of humans to think for themselves will deteriorate and eventually perish.
A2P53AN2M8IWFP	essay2	Major cities are critical to understand the important characteristics of a society. While rural areas abound in most societies, it is the major cities that feature a concentration of the population that best exhibits the characteristics of society. When you want to understand people, look to numbers. The more people you study, the greater you can understand them. If you want to understand how rats function, you don't look to one rat, you find the largest population you can find.
A2P53AN2M8IWFP	essay3	Scandals are important because they embody our societies frustrations and hang ups in a way that can be understood for the masses. Although it is often clear what problems affect a society, a scandal acts as a turning point for change. Only when we can clearly see a problem in a direct way, can we change it. A scandal allows people to form plans, to act, and to solve a problem.
A2P7Z2TKGACY2E	essay1	I do believe with how rapidly technology is advancing, the need for human intelligence will deteriorate. However, there will still be a strong need for it. It would be incredibly difficult to have a robot show genuine feelings such as compassion or empathy. Even if this feat was reached, it would still feel disingenuous to people who knew they were interacting with a robot. As such, the need for human intelligence to remain in roles such as therapist and counselor would still very much be needed.
A2P7Z2TKGACY2E	essay2	I don't necessarily believe you must understand a societies major cities to be able to identify their important characteristics. Mostly due to the face that characteristics of a city are entirely subjective. If you ask one person how they feel about their city and those who live in it, their answer may be completely different than that of someone you may ask a block away. Everyone will have a different view. Therefore, to understand the important characteristics of a society, all you must study is the people there themselves, and draw your own conclusions from it.
A2P7Z2TKGACY2E	essay3	It is not useful to use scandals to focus our attention on other problems. Nowadays it is being detected easily. People are becoming aware of the fact that scandals are used as tools now. These tools can be used to rip our attention away from one major problem and redirect it to something that isn't important. They are not useful tools in today's society anymore.
A2PP8CMYUETKL4	essay1	I believe the statement about technology solving problems for human decreases are ability to think for ourselves. I believe this because I am no longer able to read a map efficiently and I am completely unable to solve division and multiplication problems. Since I lack abilities I once had this supports my position. I also have poor communicative skills because once I am in a group I usually just look at my phone. Another disadvantage of mine is how difficult it is for me to read a analog clock because I can just look at my phone for digital time. All in all technology decreases human
A2PP8CMYUETKL4	essay2	I believe this statement to be some what true. Though I believe that smaller cities hold wonderful aspects about society the major cities are more diverse. Major cities also have a larger pool to gather data from. I used to live in a small city but no I live in a big city and the difference between culture and number of people was immense. All in all the sheer population of major cities should be enough for researchers of this statement to obviously see that major cities are a much better data set.
A2PP8CMYUETKL4	essay3	I believe that scandals are not useful as opposed to a reformers policies our ideas that grab our attention. One could say that a scandal does distract from important issues of or society. Just look at the trump scandal with Russia that is still going on in the press after a year and a half almost. This scandal distracts America from the important issues that speakers talk about like gun control and climate change. All in all the public might be less entertained with less scandals but America and the world as a whole would get more use if there was less.
A2QQC5GL2K6YYI	essay1	 People rely on technology more now then ever. The ability for people to think and learn for themselves has significantly been hindered. The fact that most people would rather look up something quick and read a quick paragraph rather then read a book is a huge problem. Books have much more facts and detail than the internet. To top it off the internet proves to be extremely unreliable and misleading. This ultimately causes people to be severely misinformed about certain subjects.
A2QQC5GL2K6YYI	essay2	 I believe if someone wants to really understand certain societies it is important to study it's major cities. Cities are different in every area and place and in the world. You wouldn't be able to fully understand their society without first learning more about how the city works. You would need to take into consideration certain aspects such as crime rate, income, businesses and schools. Without knowing these important parts of the city you would not be able to understand it's society.
A2QQC5GL2K6YYI	essay3	 Scandals are absolutely horrible. No ones attention should be directed towards something that is made up just to take away from the bigger problems. The fact that our government comes up with these make believe stories to hide important issues is as low as it gets. We all have a right to be informed. Our government has the responsibility of letting us know the truth about what is going on in this world. A scandal is no different then someone you trust lying right to your face and making you believe them just to take the heat off of something worse that they have done.
A2S4YDJ9UGAXFQ	essay1	I agree with the sentiment above. I believe that eventually humans will turn to things like robotics to solve most of their issues. This will lead to a deterioration of not only thinking ability but physical ability as well. I don't think these developments are all that surprising honestly. Throughout history the driving force behind many technologies was to solve problems and inconveniences.  That is something that has not changed to this day.
A2S4YDJ9UGAXFQ	essay2	I agree that to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities. When studying a society I believe it's fairly obvious that you would need to take a look at how the people of said society act in large congregated groups. This allows the person studying to see how the people react to and get along with one another. It's also a good oppurtunity to study social groups within said society. That is, to see how the society breaks people down into classes and subgroups.
A2S4YDJ9UGAXFQ	essay3	I don't believe scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could. Many times with scandals it seems like the issue is often overblown. In many cases it seems like it's more of a public humiliation where people enjoy seeing someone mess up rather than actual identifying and rectifying the person's behavior. Sometimes scandals even turn into witch hunts where no evidence is even give for the charges that are brought against the people. Overall I simply believe that scandals end up just being a waste of time.
A2S7SSGYBNVX8H	essay1	"I disagree with this point of view because I believe that technology solves a lot of problems that humans are constantly dealing with.  The small problems that technology solve are freeing up energy in the mind to solve more complex problems that only humans can solve.  For example, we do not need to memorize phone numbers or directions anymore because our smartphones and computers do all of that for us.  This frees up ""space"" in the mind to solve more complex problems and do other things that require that cognitive ability.  Technology also gives us the piece of mind that we know we don't have to worry about getting lost or remembering anything because we can record it digitally or pull up the info that we need in the matter of a few clicks and keywords on a keyboard.  Humans have always been able to solve complex problems but have been bogged down with menial tasks that we still must complete.  Technology removes that menial task requirement and lets us live more satisfying lives."
A2S7SSGYBNVX8H	essay2	I do not agree with this statement because there are people everywhere in any given country or society.  The hubs for creativity and humanities are often found in the major cities but there is much more to society than that.  Society has never really been judged by major cities anyway because we collectively are not all in a major city so society views change from person to person.  Major cities might be able to give a researcher easy access to a lot of people but good research dictates that you have a broad and deep pool of people and things to study.  If we just consider major cities a lot of people and cultures get left out of someones framing of society which is very unfortunate.
A2S7SSGYBNVX8H	essay3	Scandals are indeed useful for focusing attention because it draws emotion out of people because something was done or perceived as being wrong.  The emotional reaction to something will certainly draw attention to things if it strikes a chord in someone.  A reformer or speaker may also draw this attention but in a different way because they are just delivering a message or trying to change something.  A scandal is different because someone messed up and people are drawn to that sort of drama and feel connected because they often times thrust themselves into the drama.  People also like to see others fail unfortunately and a scandal is the perfect situation to watch someone fail.  The effectiveness of a scandal to draw upon an emotional response will always be more effective than any speaker or reform movement.
A2SKXKH9YXZYRI	essay1	As time progresses I think we'll see human thinking deteriorate in some ways and improve in others. The human brain is a neural network and areas that are used more grow and become stronger and areas that are used less become weaker. We've already seen some changes in how the brain works because of technology. Attention spans have declined because people are constantly interrupted by smart phones and e-mail and other technological distractions. Memory has also taken a hit because we don't need to remember everything, we just have to remember a little bit of information and where to find more details if we need it, such as wikipedia. However, I expect that since the brain is being used less to store knowledge and maintain attention that it has more resources to deal with other tasks, such as planning how to solve more long-term problems.
A2SKXKH9YXZYRI	essay2	Given that world population continues to rise and that global climate change is going to force people to relocate, I would expect that in the future we will all be living in bigger cities than we are currently. So, since we will all be living in what we would call a major city, I think looking at the major cities of today will reveal the most important characteristics of society (if not society now, then surely society of the future). We need to understand how people produce garbage, how people move, etc, so that we can build disposal and transportation systems to meet the needs of a growing population and major cities are the best places for us to find those answers. If we don't look at major cities now, we'll be unprepared for the future.
A2SKXKH9YXZYRI	essay3	Scandals are just that, a single solitary scandal of a single solitary individual. They do not focus attention on problems, if anything they detract from the actual problem as people get caught up in the people and personalities involved in the particular scandal. As an example, there have been many #metoo type scandals over the years, and nothing has ever really come of it. #metoo offers an exception to this rule though, if you have a wave of scandals (dozens within a period of months, such as #metoo) then it can focus attention on a problem in a way that no single scandal could. If fact, many of the #metoo allegations are old news, but taken as a collective wave they have a power that they never did separately. So, scandals do not focus attention, but if you have a wave of scandals then you can focus attention on a problem.
A2TVJTQ4VXATE6	essay1	 I highly agree with this assessment in general. I think when technology does everything for you, then you never have any real need or desire to truly think for yourself. I think it's important that we all learn how to do most things ourselves as it challenges our thinking ability and evolves us into smarter people. Technology might make our lives easier as a whole, but I fear that it may lead to a deteriorating education as schools may find certain topics unnecessary to teach because of technology.
A2TVJTQ4VXATE6	essay2	"I think people who live in big cities are the most influenced by society in general. Those who grow up away from these big cities often act different or have different ideals as they are less subjected to society as a whole. People have a ""herd mentality"" in the sense they will follow the majority in what they think and believe so their characteristics and ideologies will be very similar to each other in major cities."
A2TVJTQ4VXATE6	essay3	I don't personally see how scandals are useful as all as I feel like they just distract our attention away from the real issues. While everyone is focused on allegations that may or may not be true, they could instead be focusing on the issues that need to be dealt with. I do agree that it's good when someone does something scandalous that they are exposed for it, but when there is no real proof of it then it's nothing but a distraction to me.
A2TYPIODA4XDSW	essay1	I disagree with the statement, I believe technology will do the opposite. It will help human beings think for themselves better. Technology will help human beings be more productive and find more knowledge . A relativly small group of humans will think less for themselves, but most will do the opposite. The relationships between humans and technology will improve as humans learn how to use it better.
A2TYPIODA4XDSW	essay2	I agree with this statement, because most of the human population is in the major cities. That means that most of the culture, buildings, and other things that make up a society are in major cities. Most of the studying of human society must take place in major cities. Only a small part must take place in suburbs and small towns. Major cities are very important to study when understanding society.
A2TYPIODA4XDSW	essay3	I agree with this statement, scandals are needed to focus our attention on problems. It gives people a good example of what the problem is. It also increases the attention that the problem gets to very high levels. The amount of attention that scandals get motivate people to try to stop problems. Many problems would not be solved without scandals because people would just ignore the problems.
A2U54QV66WRRTY	essay1	As the proliferation of technology increases in society, there is an increasing dichotomy between those who have been intellectually hobbled by technology and those who have flourished under its influence. The members of the first group: those whose intellectual abilities have been decreasing as technology rises are those who spend most of their time sharing articles without reading them, participating in online echo chambers, and not bothering to grow as individuals, content to look at pictures of cats and celebrities all day. The latter group - those who have benefited intellectually from the proliferation of technology - have been able to gain access to educational materials and take advantage of opportunities to better themselves and their minds.
A2U54QV66WRRTY	essay2	While the major cities in society are where one may be able to gain a knowledge of  the cultural centers, or governmental processes of a society, it bears mentioning that there are far too many important characteristics of a society that exist on the outskirts of any given metropolis. China, for example, is known for its major cities such as Hong Kong and Shanghai. but it is also known for its vast expanse of farm land and,as well as the massive wealth of people who live far outside the walls of those great cities. There are many important lessons to be learned within the walls of major cities, but disregarding the countryside and rural folk of a society will leave any traveler or scholar with only a small piece of the whole story of a culture.
A2U54QV66WRRTY	essay3	Scandals are definitely a tool that could act as the grease that helps get the wheels of progress moving, but we must be careful that they do not become the focus of a movement. In these days of the 24 hour news cycle and media overload, it is almost insurmountably difficult to turn the public's head for any significant amount of time. It almost seems as if you need a fat, juicy scandal to pique the interest of a few so that you can potentially seize the interest of many. But as with anything, moderation is key. It is important to not lose sight of how quickly people today are willing to turn completely on a public figure or a movement because of a scandal or slip-up. What one thinks might stir up some attention might inadvertently turn the tide completely and end up shooting a movement in the foot.
A2UIHBB5MDLLSV	essay1	I absolutely agree that humans' ability to think for themselves will deteriorate was technology advances. One example of this, sadly, is my own son. I homeschool him and he is constantly asking me what words mean throughout the day, which I don't mind at all. After a while I explained to him the importance of using a dictionary and told him that he should learn how to look words up in the dictionary instead of asking me the definitions. Now, instead of asking me or referring to his dictionary, he just asks Google or Alexa. I have to force him to look words up in the dictionary. And if given the choice, he'll choose not looking the word up and never finding the meaning over using his dictionary to solve his problem.
A2UIHBB5MDLLSV	essay2	I agree that to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities. This holds true due to the fact that major cities will include almost every major demographic. You will get an idean of how the rich live in relation to the poor, how the homeless are treated, and how the school system is set up. You will be able to observe the dominant religion by observing the places of worship in the city. You can also study police records to see what types of crimes are commited the most and which which demographics. A society's major cities are a wealth of information.
A2UIHBB5MDLLSV	essay3	Scandals certainly are useful in focusing one's attention on problems in ways that speakers cannot. This is because scandals are full of drama. People like feeling like they lead better lives than others. And in this day and age, people also like watching drama unfold in other people's lives. Just look at reality television. The television industry has made a killing for decades now simply by televising to viewers other peoples' drama, suffering, angst, and saddness. People love a scandal, and nowadays if you want to get the average person to stop and listen to you, you need to keep them entertained!
A2UUKFTD0VUX2S	essay1	Technology has become part of our lives so much ta we rely on it so much.People have become so much lenient on it that they become so lazy and do not want to think for themselves.Human beings like the easier way out and when they want to solve an issue,the first thing they think of is google and the likes to help them solve their problems.It has become  a habit for many,including me and if this conntinues,human beings will leave everything to technology hence human labour will not
A2UUKFTD0VUX2S	essay2	It is not true that  one must study in major cities to understand the characteristics of the society.Our society has become so diversified such that different communities find themselves in a group and they are able to learn from each other a lot.Being together makes them learn a lot about differences in our society.People can also depend books and technology to learn about the society.It is therefore not a must to study in major cities to ubnderstand
A2UUKFTD0VUX2S	essay3	When scandals are in our society, we find the need to dig deeper and in the process, we find out other problems that affect us and this becomes important for us to solve our problems. We should sometimes embrace weaknesses because they make us better people and offer solutions to bigger problems affecting our society.This makes our society better.
A2V27A9GZA1NR2	essay1	I actually do agree with it. This process starts slowly, with gadgets like GPS, when shows us the way, we do not rely on our memory, or sense of orientation in the field, but simply following a purple line on the screen. Then we're getting e-books, when all our ability to read properly and fluently,  goes to trash because there is an app, reading everything for us while we don't need to do anything... there are bigger steps in this process... like self driving technology... in order to be a good driver, You need to have a good orientation in field, good reflexes and coordination. driving a car like that You don't need to do anything... it's got sensors all over the car and is making choices for You. The fact that human's ability to think and do things for themselves deteriorate
A2V27A9GZA1NR2	essay2	No I don't think I agree with this statement... society can be a big one in big cities, small one in towns but even a micro society in a class at school, or even a local neighborhood community. Characteristics of a society can be visible everywhere where there groups of people interacting with each other. Some groups of people are similar to each other and some very different. It's the kind of interaction processes that happen between those groups that have those certain characteristics. Maybe in big cities those are more complex and complicated but in smaller towns are ones that are also very important. doesn't matter how simple those can be, can be equally important and sometimes beautiful...
A2V27A9GZA1NR2	essay3	This is a dangerous statement. I think it was true maybe 20 years ago, but these days, I believe only a small percentage of scandals we see are genuine events. Now scandals are controlled and people causing them WANT to be seen and heard. They WANT to turn world attention to themselves. The REAL scandals are very rare now. WHEN it happens, then yes, it's good for a dark secret to see the light of the day and be judged by public opinion. It's very hard to see what's behind that scandal though...  we can't be sure of scandalist's intentions. There are always some secrets kept in the dark that we will never see or hear...
A2V3P1XE33NYC3	essay1	Certainly such a statement is likely true. I myself have noticed that relying upon technology, specifically the internet to research and answer questions, has created a situation where my memory is not as good as it used to be. In a day and age where we do not have to memorize facts and figures because we can look up such things in seconds, it stands to reason that our ability to think for ourselves will deteriorate. Add in social media and it's ability to manipulate or create group opinions, and to enforce these opinions against others, and I think the statement above is generally true. It's a sad situation all around, but it's likely going to cause big problems in the future. If artificial intelligence takes hold, the problem will get worse rather than better.
A2V3P1XE33NYC3	essay2	Perhaps this is a correct statement. The major cities contain most of the population of a country, depending upon where they are located, so you could get a good look at its society. Cities, however, tend to be pathological due to a number of factors. Negative emotions and negative human traits tend to express themselves more strongly in a city. It could end up that you're not getting the full story of a society merely by looking at the cities because of this. What are the other people in the society who don't live in the cities doing and what are they like? It could be the reverse of what you see in the city. You wouldn't know about it by looking at the urban areas.
A2V3P1XE33NYC3	essay3	Scandals emerge because people haven't been paying attention. In some cases, it's behavior that many people already know about, but refuse to expose for various reasons. These reasons include power, money, and even blackmail. Only when the problem gets too big to hide does it become a scandal. Speakers and reformers can focus attention on problems without there being a scandal, although certainly a scandal helps to draw attention to any given topic. It's possible to do both and still focus attention on any given problem.
A2W121DQXNQK1	essay1	I disagree on the statement that the ability of humans will degrade or deteriorate society in general relies more on technology. The human experience, rather events in the history of mankind has shown that we are naturally inclined towards the creation of technology . Our reliance on technology.has allowed humans to survive on this planet, considering we are physically equipped to survive against other species in nature.  Usage of fire, building instruments, and agricultural tools has allowed us to modernize and create cities and societies where humans can thrive. The creation of high-end technology such as smartphones, computers, and the internet are simply another aspect of human history people will look back upon to see how far we have advanced as a species. Humans still have the ability to think for themselves, and just as before people can choose to let technology dictate more aspects of their life, or less. People in general, still have the choice to utilize technology, or forgo it.
A2W121DQXNQK1	essay2	Major cities are often a good example of important characteristics of society, but it is not the only example one can look upon to determine the most important characteristics of a society. A major city is a good example of the extent architecture and infrastructure has advanced in a society, and one can see the modernization and incorporation of technology in a major city. However, many large cities suffer from a disconnected consciousness, where its members do not associate with one another strongly. This aspect of a major city is not an important characteristic. In fact, smaller towns or cities can demonstrate how being connected with one another, and the social aspects of the human experience is crucial for society. The interactions, the ways people support and help each other may be found in a major city, but it is more commonly exemplified in a smaller community.
A2W121DQXNQK1	essay3	Scandals do have a use in society, as many individuals find themselves overwhelmed with a saturation of information. The advent of technology has made it possible for many to be informed of news and events in locations far from reasonable effects. Many would overlook certain issues, or facts for irrelevance, or a focus of interest on more practical or relevant news. A scandal can draw attention to a problem, such as the case of Flint, Michigan. This city would normally have only affected its citizens, given that the water was unsafe to drink. Yet, due to the scandal, many have become aware of the situation, and had taken initiative to protest the local government in charge of the city, or provide charity for its citizens. The scandal has essentially focused the attention of many to an event, that unfortunately is not unique or rare. Many other cities likely suffer from unsafe drinking water, but the focus of society lies elsewhere.
A2W8ZODKKQ7RYP	essay1	I completely agree with this statement. We see this in the young people today, they no longer think for themselves.  From a young age kids are attached to their phones. They are given computers in school to help them with their schoolwork. These kids using this technology do not know how to go the library and research information, and some can not do simple math without the help of their phone.  I wonder sometimes, what would happen if this technology was suddenly taken from them, even for a period of only a month.  I believe they would start to think again, to reason, to question things and not just accept  information that they are given.
A2W8ZODKKQ7RYP	essay2	I disagree with the statement that to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.  All cities are different.  Some major cities are made up of highly  respected wealthy people, and some are not. Some major cities have very high crime rates, and some very low crime rates.  Characteristics of society in general cannot be determined this way. I believe one must take a broader view of society.  A perfect example would be Detroit, once a major city near me.  Years ago it was thriving and full of wonderful people.  Kids could play on the streets and leave the house unlocked at night.  That major city is now full of very different people with very different characteris
A2W8ZODKKQ7RYP	essay3	I disagree that scandals are useful.  Scandals are not something that attention should be drawn to. They are usually private issues that should remain private and out of the public eye.  An exception to this would be scandal within a public company that directly affects the public. I still believe that these scandals should be handled with care.  Attention should not be drawn to scandals and word of mouth and media tend to twist the facts and make things worse.
A2WNVSJ1Y06SS1	essay1	        I completely disagree that humans' ability to think for themselves will deteriorate with the advance of technology. Humans do rely a lot on technology in this day and age, but we have hardly become ineffective because of it. Due to technological advancement, we have become even smarter and effective at dealing with problems than ever before. Humans have been able to travel long distances, cure diseases, and even travel in space due to technological advances. Over time, we have increased the capabilities of our species for the sake of convenience. This is convenience that humans have come to rely on, but if it were to all disappear, humans would not go extinct. We have a lot of knowledge on the world due to the resources we have available, and because of this, we will continue to thrive.
A2WNVSJ1Y06SS1	essay2	        I do not agree that you can learn the most important characteristics of society in a major city. Yes, it is true that major cities have large amounts of the population, but that does not make them complete examples of a society. Society is comprised of so much more than what a city includes, and much of the population cannot be generalized so easily. City life is completely different in different parts of a country so much so that its impossible to gather such generalizations from a group of cities. For example, if you took Chicago, Illinois and compared it to Phoenix, Arizona, you would find that these cities are even very far apart in the way that they operate and how they fit within American society. Society itself is so intricate and complicated being made up of so many unique individuals, there is no way that you can clearly get the picture of a specific society solely by looking at a relatively small and specific portion of it.
A2WNVSJ1Y06SS1	essay3	        I do not think scandals are that useful. In today's world, information is readily available to the public about anything and everything that goes on in the world. While this is good for engaging in politics, we live in a world where we may not be able to trust all the information provided. Human nature, especially regarding positions of power, is to benefit ones' self. This means that information may be fabricated in order to damage one's reputation and therefore boost the reputation of another. Though we have many more resources available to use to determine some truth in the statements of others, there are also more ways to fabricate information and pass it off as being the truth. This makes it difficult to trust any of the information you're given on such scandals from both sides of the debate. Because absolute truth is rather impossible for an individual to discern, scandals serve many times to confuse the public and are often very distracting.
A2WT6FV92737W6	essay1	I agree that using technology to solve problems deteriorates the ability for humans to think for themselves. The brain is something that needs to be exercised every day. Technology decreases the exercise that the brain gets. Technology helps people solve problems that they would normally use their brains for. Over time the brain slows down from being underused. Humans begin to lose confidence in themselves and their brain power and start to rely more on technology. This starts to become a never ending cycle.
A2WT6FV92737W6	essay2	I agree that you need to study major cities to understand the most important characteristics of a society. Major cities are heavily influenced by the characteristics of a society. The values and personalities of the people in a society can shape a city in many ways. People that display hard working characteristics will have cities that have buildings that are built with great attention to detail and are very reliable and sturdy. A great artistic society will have structures that are very beautiful and impressive. A society that honors tradition will have buildings that embrace past generations.
A2WT6FV92737W6	essay3	I agree that scandals can be very useful. Sometimes people have to witness something with their own eyes or hear things themselves before they will believe. You can speak to people and try to get them to listen but scandals are that much more effective. Sex scandals are some of the most effective attention grabbers. People who won't believe that a certain person is bad or corrupt can have their eyes opened by a sex scandal. Scandals have a way of uniting a large number of people for a common cause. Scandals tend to stir up emotions in people and make them more focused and attentive to problems in society.
A2WWYVKGZZXBOB	essay1	I disagree with this position somewhat. It seems to me that building such technology will take a lot of research and brainpower, and to maintain and improve these technologies it will take that same amount of vast brainpower. Maybe the average person won't improve their intelligence, but they don't really do that now. There will always be those who wish to pursue their own education and improve their ability to think. Humans are a forward driving species no matter what level of technology we are at. We are always looking to improve our own understanding of the world.
A2WWYVKGZZXBOB	essay2	There is some truth to this. Cities are a hub, where different, conflicting and compatible ideas merge into one. Take New York for example, with its many racial representatives, all bringing different things from their culture to one place. People take in the ideas they like and over the course of generations disperse either back to where they came from or to new places, spreading those ideas around. City dwellers tend to be more progressive in their ideas, which would be more useful to research than rural ideas, which often have stayed the same for many centuries without being challenged. Cities tend to write the history of society.
A2WWYVKGZZXBOB	essay3	This is true to some extent. Often, however, scandals are used to distract the public from real problems going on. This is common tactics amongst politicians, who attempt to disguise their own immoral or illegal actions by putting attention on a political opponent. For example, Donald Trump's insensitive tweets could distract the public from outrage over some of his policies that he's trying to push through. On the other hand, scandals are useful for keeping powerful people in check and within the law. It puts pressure on them to show they are not immune from society's norms.
A2XOP6WJGR59QR	essay1	I don't really know what side to pick on this issue, but I don't completely agree with the issue. It's true the more that we rely on technology to solve our problems, our ability to actually think for ourselves will deteriorate, but on the flip side, technology enables us to reach new heights that we will most likely never reach ourselves. With the way tech is evolving, it will only become more beneficial in the long run for the human race as a whole. As long as we don't rely on tech to do everything in our lives for us, it'll free time for many of us, allowing us to pursue our interests and dreams even further than before. Using technology has only helped us grow as a whole, and it shall most likely continue for a quite a while longer. There is so much more we can do now that we have the tech to do it.
A2XOP6WJGR59QR	essay2	It really depends. Lots of major cities tend to be a blend of different cultures and may not truly reflect the characteristics and beliefs of a society. Perhaps the roots of that society is not only in its major cities, but spread out throughout the land. Different areas tend to have different views on many things, but there most likely is a characteristic that binds them all together. A society's major cities characteristics may be a bit muddled though, considering that many major areas tend to bring something from every corner of its society. One can't really base a society's most important characteristic on a few cities, I suppose.
A2XOP6WJGR59QR	essay3	Depending on the severity of the scandal, yes. Not many would care too much for minor scandals, but the major scandals are what really grab our attention. Knowing that the prominent people in our lives have a darker side tend to open our eyes a bit more to the problems around us. Knowing that say, a politician or similar is a member of a rather sinister cult might get us to focus on the cult and the trouble they bring. Perhaps a well known celebrity beating their spouse would bring attention to spouse abuse/problems that go in inside many households. Or something as simple as a leader smuggling money out of the country.
A2XVL0RNQMWI17	essay1	As technology evolves human intelligence and creativity will not deteriorate. In fact it will increase as technology advances. Much of the time of early humans was used to find food. With advances in technology we were able to free up this time through farming. Specialized roles became possible. Centers of learning became possible. As technology continues to advance people will have even more free time to create and work on other skills which will advance human knowledge even more.
A2XVL0RNQMWI17	essay2	To understand the most characteristics of a society we must look at rural, suburban, as well as urban areas. The arrangement of these communities tells us how people of different classes behave. Things such as agriculture, and unique businesses, can be missed when studying major cities. Major cities only offer a limited view of society. For instance political ideologies tend to differ based on if you live in a rural area or urban area. The role of government varies in different areas. Natural resources which contribute to business would also not be studied very well if one were to focus on major cities only.
A2XVL0RNQMWI17	essay3	Scandals are useful because it is publicized incident which grabs the attention of many people. People are affected by scandals emotionally and will want to do something about it. It is better having one common incident to rally people around. There are many instances where policy was created and approved after a strong scandal. This does not always occur especially when people are divided on how to react to a scandal.
A2YAYHZYI7M3HD	essay1	I think there is truth in that idea. As we rely more and more on technology, we will rely less on ourselves and our own wits. Technology, in its most extreme usage, promotes laziness. If we don't have to do for ourselves, we won't have to puzzle over problems and those faculties will start to weaken through disuse. I think too much technology is a slippery slope.
A2YAYHZYI7M3HD	essay2	I think this is true. In cities you have large numbers of people living near each other. It's a good way to view an array of characteristics in one area. You can see what the people are like, how they interact, what they do with their time. You can see the big picture in miniature in a city. I think it could be an efficient way of getting the most information with the least effort.
A2YAYHZYI7M3HD	essay3	I can see the truth in this. Often when scandals come to light, it gets people talking about an issue and it inspires people to do something more about it. It raises awareness and sometimes acts as a chain reaction, in that more people who have suffered something similar will come forward. The more discussion and action there is, the more we can prevent similar things from happening in the future. I think, in that way, there is value in scandal.
A2YDA5EGPSTMCC	essay1	I personally disagree with the assessment that an over-reliance on technology will impair our collective cognitive capacities as a species. Centuries ago in Ancient Greece, Socrates produced a similar argument with respect to the appropriation and proliferation of literature, among other things. Socrates argued that an over-reliance on written text would diminish the memory and storage capabilities of the human mind, weakening their capacity to give oral arguments and orate effectively. However, oration still remains an important aspect of certain academic programs and professions. This same argument was applied to every major transition in the history of human society, from literature to the radio, to television - all the way to video games. Society has come to accommodate to these new technological acquisitions consistently.
A2YDA5EGPSTMCC	essay2	This isn't necessarily the case. A society first and foremost is comprised of two things - a collection or population of people, and culture. Culture is a direct byproduct of individual human behavior, aggregated into a collective whole. As such, cities only allow for a partial window into the complexities and intricacies of human behavior as they pertain to a population of people. This is because rural areas, suburbs and other locales are places which still hold significant numbers of people, each with their own unique and distinctive microcosms of culture and human behavior. As such, it is impossible to construe a definitive whole picture of humanity from cities alone.
A2YDA5EGPSTMCC	essay3	"While scandals do indeed focus the collective attention of a society on the matter at hand - they are far from ""useful"". For something to be useful, it must hold a valuable insight into a given situation, or provide the skills, information or context necessary to assess and overcome said situation. Scandals satisfy neither of these necessary requirements, as they only serve to exacerbate the situation itself. They serve as a means of providing either entertainment or the catalyst for a moral shock to society at large. Because of this, scandals cannot constitute the conditions necessary towards being ""useful"" to society."
A2YH9MQZQY449I	essay1	 It would not be the same, since we have people who use technology to provide more knowledge in our lives.
A2YH9MQZQY449I	essay2	Carry out a specific study to be able to acquire the culture of that society and be able to share technological information between the two societies
A2YH9MQZQY449I	essay3	 It's true, because the bigger a problem is, the more attention will be paid in a society
A2YP60DM1HYTH8	essay1	I totally agree with this statement. We rely on technology so much now that we hardly ever think for ourselves. We are consumed with technology, even with the easiest tasks, if it can be done using any sort of technology, that is the first thing we go to. We try to use the easiest way possible. In a way we have lost some of our worth ethnic. We rely too heavily on technology to do everything for us.
A2YP60DM1HYTH8	essay2	I don't agree with this. There are different people in all parts of the state, you can't categorize people just because of the major city. I live near a major city that I don't associate with at all. The people, the culture, the way they do things is completely irrelevant to me. I feel like it is not fair to just judge a society just because of the major cities.
A2YP60DM1HYTH8	essay3	I feel like scandals are just ways to get attention. I feel like everyone is looking for the newest scandal because everyone loves drama. I don't feel like a scandal can say more than someone else could. A lot of things can be taken out of contexts, and I feel like it is all a rue to drum up attention in the media. I feel like scandals are blown out of proportion.
A2Z6NL0CTXY0ZB	essay1	There is growing evidence that proves today's technology can hamper learning abilities. This has become a serious problem among young people who spend much of their time in front of their cell phones. It was recently reported that young people are having a difficult time learning to write. Those of us born before the advent of the smart phone know that writing is one of the most important of the three 'R's. Such a skill is taught in the early stages of education. But in today's world it seems that children are born with cell phones in the hands, making it more impossible for them to learn.
A2Z6NL0CTXY0ZB	essay2	There's only so much a person can learn at home. The world is a big place filled with people form all walks of life. I agree that to understand portions of society, one should expand his/her horizons. Moving to an overcrowded city isn't necessary. There are smaller metropolis' in the country that offer the same or similar experiences. But if one wants to really learn about the world, moving to a different country for a year or more is one way to do so. People outside of your home country may have a view of your society that may just open your eyes.
A2Z6NL0CTXY0ZB	essay3	I disagree that scandals are useful. What is a scandal after all? A messy exchange between several parties who should learn to keep their business private? What's learned from a scandal? Hardly anything seeing as how there seems to be one every week on the news. If anything, a scandal is a good example for those of us who are attempting to live a morally acceptable quiet to keep doing what they are doing. And teach their children not to get involved with anything that may lead to a scandal. Other than that, I don't see scandals serving any good to society. They should be kept under the rug if discovered.
A2ZV96GRXVSXK4	essay1	This makes me thing of my 1st grade teacher and her telling me that I need to learn to do math without a calculator since I will never carry one around in my pocket . I think technology has made us a bit lazy when it comes to working out math on paper , the calculator is so convenient and easier to use . Plus do you always have a pen ?
A2ZV96GRXVSXK4	essay2	Major cities are just bigger points to where people find things more conveniently . There are lots of characteristics of society that are never in a big city . Smalls towns have more character then big cities . I think you have to look at society as a WHOLE rather than just a larger city . Like if you used LA as the example for society then you would be dead wrong on alot of idea and choices people make .
A2ZV96GRXVSXK4	essay3	Scandals are always going to be there . IT is drama and some people thrive on it . Its what makes us so interested in celebrities and their lives . We have entire TV networks (E!) that are based off of scandal and drama
A2ZZ036CZCJJR0	essay1	I disagree with this statement. As technology advances, people will actually need to think even more in order to use this new technology. Technology doesn't run automatically. Computers need someone to program it and even robots need instructions in order to do things. Self-driving cars also need someone behind the wheel to make sure that it is not malfunctioning. If something breaks, people will need to be there to fix it. Technology may make people lazier, however, it will not stop humans from thinking for themselves.
A2ZZ036CZCJJR0	essay2	I agree that in order to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities. We know a lot more about ancient Mayan, Aztec and Inca cultures by studying the ruins of their major cities. Looking at cities like New York, Chicago, LA and Miami, we can determine a lot about how our society lives. We must also study smaller cities as well to get a full picture of society. For example, if we study only NYC or Chicago, we might think that our society primarily lives in high-rise apartments and condos, when, in fact, most people live in single family houses. In order to get a full look at a society, we should study both major cities and smaller towns and villages.
A2ZZ036CZCJJR0	essay3	While I agree that scandals can shed light on problems and solutions that we might never have thought of, I disagree that they are useful. Scandals are inconvenient and often hurt others. They should be avoided at all costs. We should really be focusing our attention on problems that affect others such as affordable housing, rising gas prices, unemployment or the economy instead of focusing our attention on scandals and crime. If we spent more time putting our attention on problems that are apparent, we could get more done. It is the right thing to do.
A300U36A83F1TQ	essay1	yes, all people solve the technology problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate , as people rely more on technology to solve problems
A300U36A83F1TQ	essay2	The most important society is must major city. The people can take overall confident finish any problem, but there is not a good way. The human can change mind. the critical area is not complete life study. The human life dangerous of all areas but major for one city. the society is important for the character because the character life goal, day to day life change everything but cannot change character.
A300U36A83F1TQ	essay3	The human life is most important factor is Scandal because the people take over charge is scandal. The politician and government is important for the scandal. The focus is attention but there is no speaker or reformer ever could. The main important is scandal stage, it can any cash department, society and more people advantage.
A30KV6CIGNH3E5	essay1	I disagree with the above sentiment. humans ability to think has not reduced. it has increased actually. people have become more creative with the help of technology. technology just makes work easier .
A30KV6CIGNH3E5	essay2	i agree with the above sentiment. major cities contain the most crucial information about a place. the people there can be very helpful too. major cities also have the information required. the social amenities in major cities are crucial too.
A30KV6CIGNH3E5	essay3	scandals can be very useful. i agree with this sentiment. they help people bring out things that were bothering them. in doing so no one's feelings are hurt. scandals also help improve relationships . communications become better after scandals.
A30YUB0WTMKX73	essay1	I completely agree with this statement.  With the reliance on technology becoming more prevalent, people will not be as motivated to educate themselves.  Eventually, this will be very harmful, as people will lack important mathematical and grammatical skills that are required to function in everyday life.  Additionally, instead of trying to work out an issue in their head, people will only be able to rely on doing an internet search for the answer.  Therefore, I believe that increased reliance on technology will definitely result in the deterioration of the ability for humans to think for themselves.
A30YUB0WTMKX73	essay2	Studying major cities can be very beneficial when examining the characteristics of a society.  To begin with, the major cities are typically the center of the society, so they are great places to see what a society is like.  Additionally, the society will be very well represented in the city's population, so it will be easy to examine and learn about the culture and traditions of the society.  Major cities also show the different patterns and habits of the society, which would give a great picture of the society's characteristics.  Therefore, when attempting to understand the important characteristics of a society, one should definitely examine its major cities.
A30YUB0WTMKX73	essay3	Scandals are useful in that they present new, and typically shocking situations that nobody has ever seen or witnessed before.  They help us become aware of things that are possible in society.  Additionally, scandals help teach us a lesson that can be used as an example of what to avoid and what not to do in the future.  Scandals can also enhance awareness of negative societal issues that might not be very prevalent yet, which would help us start the process to resolve them.  Therefore, scandals are very useful for focusing our attention on problems in different ways than those of speakers or reformers.
A3135Y3RMFC3PK	essay1	I think this has already started to happen. For myself I no longer even try to remember phone numbers because I carry a phone. People are relying more on gadgets to do things for them and when those gadgets break or have no power they are lost. I'm not sure younger people would even fully know how to use a library now to do research.  Everything is available online. You can sit in a chair and turn everything on and off now just by issuing a command. You can even lock or unlock your house and car from miles away. I love technology so these are not complaints. I do see it dumbing some people down however. Some people will decide they do not need anything for backup and be completely lost if it's not done for them.
A3135Y3RMFC3PK	essay2	I think that is something that would need to be studied but it cannot be the only thing. Society is made up of different classes and different ways of living. Without the rural areas and contributions then the city would not be able to thrive. I think it's wrong to discount someone who might not be a part of a higher society simply because you feel you are above them. When it comes to basic survival we all play a part. Society needs all its parts. It is all important.
A3135Y3RMFC3PK	essay3	I can see where they have a use. It does bring to mind that people we may idolize are no different than us. I'm not sure it always has us focus on problems that aren't already brought up. I think it brings it into more of a public view but it's usually things some of use are already dealing with privately. I think a scandal can make it acceptable to talk about a subject so maybe in that way it is truly the most useful. It could make people face a situation and not try to ignore that it exists.
A31A4YKVSOYRVS	essay1	I disagree with this statement, personally. I think that it's clear that as we move into the future, we are moving towards a singularity where man and technology will become one. In the meantime, we've been blurring the lines more and more with each passing year and new technological innovation. Rather than hindering our development, I think that this technology will help us to unlock so much of our potential. Think about virtual reality. Many people believe that soon we will have implants that allow us to view virtual reality through our own eyes. When this happens, it will completely change the way that we learn in school, the way that we complete our work, the way that we go about our day to day lives. I think that technology will change the way that we are able to perceive things. Our senses may be heightened in the same way that we are finding ways to help blind people to see and deaf people to hear. On top of that, with technology taking a lot of the workload off of humanity, people will have more time to become spiritual and philosophical which will cause us to move forward leaps and bounds.
A31A4YKVSOYRVS	essay2	You could compare our cities to our homes. First of all, our homes are designed to suit the average person's needs from top to bottom. The door ways are perfectly sized, the hinges are meant to match our average right handedness, and houses are even designed to induce a sense of peace and calm through their layout. Secondly, people tailor their homes to represent their deepest selves. They are designed and stocked with the things that we love. In the same way, a city might be a huge reflection of the civilian population that lives in it. It is designed functionally for the people and it is designed aesthetically for the people. In the future, historians could look at our cities and use them to deduce what type of people we were, what our priorities were, what our needs were, what our lives were like, and what our culture was like. It's the same way that we can look back at ancient cities and put together the whole world at that time. What's really cool is the fact that our cities throughout time share lots of features, which seems to represent common trends of humanity that span millennia.
A31A4YKVSOYRVS	essay3	I disagree with the sentiment that scandals, and the distractions that they provide, are useful for people. I feel exactly the opposite. The powers that be utilize that scheme constantly to distract people from the important issues. Scandals appeal to the worst parts of our human natures- people become excited over drama for some reason. No civilized human should be so happy about that kind of chaos, but for some reason people flock to gossip and love to debate their opinions about each and every scandal. These stories are so emotionally driven that people become especially invested and vulnerable to manipulation. There are so many classic times throughout history where scandal and drama have been used to distract people from something corrupt. Most recently you see the way that the media and politicians of America have us all caught up in this big back and forth liberal verses conservative game that is actually nothing important and only keeping us distracted from the gravely serious events taking place in the world right now.
A31FD3QCYZ28Q2	essay1	I think that humans have an inbuilt ability to problem-solve. The ability to problem solve emerged as an evolutionary advantage, unrelated to modern technology. We may individually lose skills and particular taught skills may drop out of use. But the ability to problem solve in itself will not be 'bred out' because we aren't using it.   We learned to use stones as weapons and hammers because they gave us an advantage over other competing animals. So I don't think computers are re
A31FD3QCYZ28Q2	essay2	I disagree that the idea that the most important characteristics of a society can be seen in cities. Pre-revolutionary France had a very distinctive style of society. It was feudal based on peasants at the bottom. Their condition and work were ones that were the foundation of the society. Studying their condition and understanding them will show much about the rest of the society. Ignoring rural populations and no
A31FD3QCYZ28Q2	essay3	"I think scandals are not helpful when trying to look at issues and problems. The problem is that most scandals are sex or gossip related. While they bring a focus on something, the journalistic drive is normally financial rather than the 'truth'. Political scandals in the news are gossip and innuendo, such as the 'email scandal\ of Hilary Clinton. Rather than Nixon's ""Watergate"". There is hardly any provable facts."
A3209D1227UCYP	essay1	I agree that technology is causing people to use their own minds less and less. When I was growing up, there wasn't internet available like today. If I was researching a paper, I would have to go to the library, figure out how to research my topic, use the catalog to find the books, and research the topic. It required planning and thought not just to write the paper, but to research. Along the way, I learned more information than was required during my research because it took a little more digging. Now, you can find exactly what you want, when you want it, and it requires us to do less work. Effort makes us smarter and makes us learn more.
A3209D1227UCYP	essay2	"Major cities are not the most important part of societies. A large part of the population of the world, live in rural and less populated areas. We can't characterize a whole society based on a portion of the population. There is a big difference in the behaviors and values of ""city folk"" versus ""country folk,"" and we can't ignore one or the other. I think a big problem with our country, is that both of those people only care about the people that live like them. We can't forget that not everyone lives like each other."
A3209D1227UCYP	essay3	I am torn on whether scandals are useful for attention to problems. I think part of the problem, is that most people just like to gossip. I don't think many people really care about the issue surrounding the scandal. They just want to talk about how horrible the people involved are. I think that even with the amount of scandals and attention that have come with it, there is minimal change. Isn't the point to have some change? Sexual harassment, for example, has been happening for a long time. There have been sexual harassment scandals for years, and there is still no change. There have been a couple of examples made over the past year, but do women feel safer at work? I don't necessarily think so.
A320BT7PLIQVZT	essay1	Remember when we were all in school and the math teachers always said we have to learn this stuff because we wont be carrying a calculator every where we go. yeah, well so do I. And they were completely wrong. technology has come so far that we have become reliant on it. I cant tell you how many people I try to give directions to and use words like, north and easy; they look at me with a deer in the headlights look. we have now reached a point in society where I believe the majority and even figure out which direction is north. I fear for the youth, for they are naive and lack experience.
A320BT7PLIQVZT	essay2	its funny. If you look at the largest cities in america, they are all very far left leaning. then if you look at some other cities, like detroit or chicago, you will find poor black people killing each other every single day. but no one wants to look at the facts, they want to believe what they choose to believe and skew anything and everything to push their parties political agenda. these major cities are falling apart, weather its blacks killing everyone, or los angeles encouraging illegal aliens to comit felony actions like entering into the country without going through the proper process. then they have the audacity to give them welfare, food stamps, educational assistance, all on my dime. the larger the city, the more of a likley hood they will collapse from the very people running the cities.
A320BT7PLIQVZT	essay3	when I hear of scandel, hillary clinton comes to mind. Its so bazaar how if I was to commit a crime, I would get years in prison. But when certain other people do the same things, they get the fbi to break laws to hide any evidence. it is utterly ridiculous. And you expect me to obey a police officer? you expect me to obey the very laws I  see high profile politicians breaking regularly. It makes me wonder, at what point do the people over throw the government and take their country back. I am one of those people in the shadows, waiting, willing to die for that cause.
A320QA9HJFUOZO	essay1	As people rely on technology more, the ability of humans to think will not surely deteriorate. There is simply no evidence to show that this is the case. Technology has increased exponentially over the last several hundred years, and human intelligence and thinking ability has only increased. It stands to reason that further increase of technology will not render humans unable to think or reason. If anything, human intelligence and capacity for advanced thinking will likely increase as technology is improved and we come to understand the world even better. As technology becomes more advanced, so will people and our thinking abilities.
A320QA9HJFUOZO	essay2	"The statement is vague and cannot be proven one way or another. What the ""important"" characteristics of a society are is subjective and up to interpretation. Some people value certain things more than others and point to them as representative of what is important in society. A small town may show more important characteristics of a society, depending on what you decide is important. I agree that major cities in any country will give at least some insight into the country itself and its values.  This might hold true more for some societies than others."
A320QA9HJFUOZO	essay3	Scandals are sometimes useful. Sometimes scandals are not useful. Scandals can be useful in focusing our attention on an issue, but whether than is valuable depends on whether the issue itself is important or worthwhile. Some scandals that garner media attention are not very important and provide little to be learned. They are about superficial things and don't matter in the grand scheme. Other scandals, like the 'MeToo' movement involve more important issues and can effectively focus society's attention on an issue that needs to be addressed. It depends entirely on the context and circumstances of the scandal in question.
A32IRN8APZMCQ2	essay1	In the technological I believe people ability will not deteriorate. To live in the technological world it will determine to most intelligent people to keep up with the technological.  Technology is always changing and one needs to always be very intelligent to work with it. It can help the brain muscles to always be learning something keeping away from  watching television with no use to think. People will have more intelligence increase.
A32IRN8APZMCQ2	essay2	One would best to understand the characteristics of the society by  understanding their cities People will have a better understanding talking to the people there where they live and do business. They will will have a better picture in their mind of the culture of people when they speak to them.  They will understand their process of living by peoples location by the cities towns and their living styles. So it is good to know their major cities.
A32IRN8APZMCQ2	essay3	Scandals do not focus our attention on problems because we should not be focusing on something more positive. For example if we focus on our problems then we will always be standing among negativity of speakers and reformers. For to focus our attention on problems is not healthy for anyone to live by. We should not listen reformers and those kind of speakers. So we should be positive.
A33L61XKPX76DB	essay1	I agree with the statement about how as people rely more on technology their ability to think for themselves will deteriorate. You can see this if you look back as technology has increased people have lost the ability to provide food for themselves less people know how to farm or hunt. They rely on society to provide food and the amount of farmers has decreased and people just rely on super markets to buy sustenance. I think because of the rise of technology you also see people not learn life skills or how to interact with others in person because they are so used to online interactions which leads to them being awkward in person. People are also a lot more relient on finding information online instead of learning skills from others or teaching themselves instead of just looking up the answer to their problem.
A33L61XKPX76DB	essay2	I agree that to understand the most important characteristics of a society it is important to study its major cities. This is because you can learn a lot of information from studying the major cities depending on their construction and where it is constructed. For example if a major city is constructed near the cost you can assume that they rely on fishing to provide food for the population and might do a lot of trading using boats because of the ports they have. The design of the buildings also tells you about the personalities of the people and how they might live their day to day lives. Studying the major cities also allows you to view how the populace conducts themselves and lets you see a wide subset of people and learn about their personalities. You can see how a diverse populace interacts with each other and you can use that to extrapolate
A33L61XKPX76DB	essay3	I disagree that scandals are useful although they do help focus peoples attention on certain problems unlike what a speaker or reformer could do. A lot of scandals are not worth paying attention to and distract from the bigger picture. Like the scandal with President Trump and his relationship with a porn star. This scandal isn't important and it just distracts peoples attention from more important political matters and should not be the focus of the public. This causes people to lose focus of more important political movements or messages by speakers that should be heard. Society could advance and focus on other more important issues instead of being distracted by scandals that involve unimportant things that will have no impact in our daily lives and will do nothing to improve society.
A33M7EZ72P8TWF	essay1	I agree totally with this statement. for instance since the use of calculators it has become so hard to do even the simplest of manipulation. mixing machines have taken over our kitchens and we simply put the ingredients together and let the machenes
A33M7EZ72P8TWF	essay2	I totally agree. in the cities we find all kinds of people. the cities have a representative of each part of a country, so that is the best place to start from if one wants to learn the characteristics of a society. its also the right place because people in the cities are more expressive and show their characters more easily. so the city it is
A33M7EZ72P8TWF	essay3	I am not sure I agree with the statement. I hate scandals.they cause a lot of tension in the work environment. scandals break relationships and affect how people relate to each other. after scandals have calmed down things never really go back to how they used to be. profits are lost and time is wasted.
A33QUS4NRVVMTN	essay1	Technology has many benefits, and one of those benefits is access to a wide variety of information. Rather than deteriorating ones ability to think for themselves, reliance on technology often guarantees research and understanding. Because information is plentiful, people who use technology will likely be more informed than those who do not. Technology also enhances our ability to learn. It provides relevant data and allows users to decide for themselves how they view something. Humans do not lose their ability to problem solve or think for themselves because in most cases, technology cannot be a substitute for this behavior. Technology is merely an additional tool to help cultivate problem solving and conscious thought. Resisting reliance on technology would in fact hinder one's growth and ability to think for themselves, because it limits the resources they have available to them. In this day and age, the only way to stay current is to use technology.
A33QUS4NRVVMTN	essay2	Society provides a lot of telling information about how humans interact and live. Cities are an excellent place to observe groups. They contain a vast populace, enabling characteristics of society to be more widely available for observation. The structure of cities provides a backdrop to understanding the human psyche. In a city like Miami, one would be bombarded by large buildings, bright billboards, consumerism, and hectic traffic. These elements alone provide a window into how a society operates and the values they hold dear. Consumerism, the rat race, cultural mannerisms or beliefs; all of these types of elements can be observed within a city. The way a city is constructed, maintained, and lived in paints a very vivid image of the local populace, their values, and other important societal characteristics.
A33QUS4NRVVMTN	essay3	Scandals are useful because they enable one to see what goes on behind the scenes. For example, a political scandal in the headlines will draw quite a lot of attention from both the country's populace and international eyes. Scandals cannot be simply dismissed by a speaker or explained in a manner that lessens their severity. This is what makes them so useful, and why issues are brought to light easier via scandals than other news. Most of society has an eye for scandal, and so when a scandal is reported, it gets more eyes. Further, because most scandals involve criminal activity of some kind, they cannot be sugar coated. Scandals allow the populace to see an event for how it is, regardless of the content.
A34GTM4TRKW79E	essay1	I agree with this statement. Most people learn better when they are actually doing a task. It seems the more technology advances the fewer people seem to be able to take care of themselves. If you were ta have to plant a garden, unfortunately, most people would not know how to do it. How many phone numbers could you remember 10 years ago? How many phone numbers do you remember now? This is one small example of no longer using parts of your brain.
A34GTM4TRKW79E	essay2	I agree and disagree with this comment. You will find many opposing features in society depending on where you are. It is not that one is more important then the other they are just different.
A34GTM4TRKW79E	essay3	Unfortunately, this is mostly true. A perfect example is the school shooting in Florida brought a lot of awareness to gun violence. The flip side to this is that a new scandal came and took Florida out of the spotlight. So yes it does bring awareness but only for a short time. Only in till the next scandal.
A34LRS5WXFCCIY	essay1	I disagree with the idea that humans will be less able to think for themselves as they become more reliant on technology. I believe that using technology in useful ways like that simply frees up more time and energy for people to think about other things. Technology makes the simple problem solving more efficient so we can focus on the bigger picture. To me the bigger concern is just becoming lazy and dependent on technology. If that happens then humans will be less likely to focus their efforts on productive things and will just waste their time being lazy blobs. I think overall humans will have the willpower to overcome this though and do good things.
A34LRS5WXFCCIY	essay2	I think this is a reasonable statement. Cities tend to be giant melting pots where lots of different groups end up and live side-by-side. Although there is a lot to learn from smaller towns and locations, I think those tend to show more of the extremes of a society. The more isolated a place is the more all the unique and sometimes negative characteristics seem to come out. To me a lot of the good things come from what happens in cities because different groups learn to get along. It's also where more action is happening so you see a wider range of characteristics and qualities come out.
A34LRS5WXFCCIY	essay3	Unfortunately this seems sort of true in today's world. I think people right now live in little bubbles and it is so hard to get people to listen to anything outside of that bubble. Shocking scandals seem to be the only thing that grabs people's attention sometimes and even then the bar is set so ridiculously low that it takes something really huge get people's attention. People seem so set on viewing absolutely everything through the lens that they are 100% right that they refuse to listen to opposing opinions unless they are forced to. It takes something big and dramatic to get people to see what's really going on sometime. Our society has become numb and isolated it seems like.
A34SUZWGLXIWM8	essay1	"I agree with this because I think that mental ability is just like physical muscle, if you don't use it you're going to lose it. The first thing that occurred to me is the subject of math. Growing up I was a lot better at math because I wasn't allowed to rely on computers to do the calculations for me. Today, I think my math ability has greatly diminished because any time I need to solve anything remotely difficult I turn to the calculator on my computer or tablet.  It's easy to become complacent when you have so many ""smart"" devices and apps to do the thinking for you. Fitness apps and activity trackers are a great example of how BADLY this can go wrong. People who rely too heavily on them (and don't grasp the underlying principles of diet and fitness) are often disappointed with their results. As a natural bodybuilder and a personal trainer I hear about this issue from people all the time. They basically say ""well, the app/tracker said this"", but they have no idea WHY it said that or how it arrived at such a conclusion"
A34SUZWGLXIWM8	essay2	I don't believe that society operates that differently. The major cities and the rural areas all tend to follow the same laws, same cultural norms, similar belief systems, etc. If you're studying a society under the belief that city people are different than everyone else your study is likely to be flawed from the stat. Cities may be a good example, but they aren't necessairly any better suited than other areas. I think you have to take a country as a whole in order to get a good grasp of that socitey. To do otherwise would skew the results.
A34SUZWGLXIWM8	essay3	I don't think we can classify scandals as good or bad. We have to look at the cause of each scandal and then make our decision. As you're aware, many scandals are not strictly on the up and up, politics is a great example of this. Other times, scandals point to issues that need to be resolved and are largely beneficial to society. Even then, I think most of the time a better outcome could be achieved if there had been no scandal at all...  With scandals most of the time emotions are running high, things get exaggerated, people refuse to compromise, etc. It usually becomes harder and harder to see the truth of the matter. If people were able to tackle these issues head on before it reached its boiling point (a scandal) then we would likely be able to reach solutions that (nearly) everyone could live with AND actually get to the truth of the matter (at least most of the time).
A34ZP0QJMB8X45	essay1	I agree on some level that as people come to rely more and more on technology, the thinking abilities of most people will stagnate if not deteriorate. It seems that with all the access to information that we have available today, the less people actually make use of this information in meaningful ways. The average person's knowledge base seems to have deteriorated not only because they rely on technology, but because they personally don't partake in the process of seeking and attaining knowledge, so their appreciation for knowledge in its various forms has decreased dramatically. Basically, knowledge seeking is no longer an active process that people are engaged in, it is passive.
A34ZP0QJMB8X45	essay2	"I'm not sure that one must study the major cities of a society in order to understand its important characteristics. An argument could be made in order to understand a society, you have to look at how the vast majority of its people live, and understand what they value. This very issue came to the forefront before and after the 2016 US Presidential elite. The vast majority of Americans, rural working class people, felt alienated from, misunderstood, and ignored by the ""elites"" of the major cities on the East and West coasts. The argument was made that because the elites, namely media, political, and business entities, did not understand the values, mores, and lifestyles of the average American who lives in ""flyover country"", they had no way of knowing that Donald Trump had tapped into something and would win the election. So perhaps, to understand the most important characteristics of a society, you have to get a feel for how everyday people, who live in towns and rural areas, live."
A34ZP0QJMB8X45	essay3	I believe that most scandals uncover a truth that may or may not have been under shroud of darkness up until that point. One strong recent example is the Me Too movement of 2017, which kickstarted with a bunch of sexual abuse allegations coming out against Harvey Weinstein, a major Hollywood producer. After that story broke, several other stories came out about several other Hollywood players, and then it became a social movement about breaking the silence and fear that many sexual abuse victims, mostly women, have to live with, and more importantly, exposing the people who sexually assaulted them.   The Me Too movement is one strong example of one big scandal leading to more discussion and action being taken on an issue than any one speaker or reformer could probably ever have garnered. So I would say, scandals can definitely be useful in that regard.
A353XKDTUX10NC	essay1	I think mechanization is a mixed bag. Rather leading to the deterioration of certain cognitive functions I would say that they're being depricated. Modern humans live in an environment rich in information and storage. We simply don't need to remember as much information as we used to. What's more important is that we know how to judge the quality of and discern certain types of information from others. We need to be aware of the biases inherent in the sources from which we draw our information, as well as our own cognitive biases.
A353XKDTUX10NC	essay2	I don't necessarily agree. Cities, especially coastal ones are more cosmopolitan by their nature as hubs for international import and exports. It generally costs more to live in a city than in a rural or suburban area. Therefore the demographics are going to skew towards those who are economically better off. Often migrants and expats will congregate in cities, further skewing the demographic sample away from one that is representative of the majority of the nation. Studying a major city will tell you important characteristics of that city, but for a accurate picture you must take the entire country into account.
A353XKDTUX10NC	essay3	While I can't draw on any specific examples, I agree with this assessment in theory. Important policy issues are often quite boring and involve mostly negotiation and paperwork. The average American doesn't care about the nuances of policymaking. A regrettable fact of modern politics is that it is part circus in part because the circus is the only way to stir the crowd into action. A successful governance requires a degree of bread and circuses. The bread I suppose would come in tax reforms and social services.

A355PGLV2ID2SX	essay2	To argument to the understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities is a narrow-minded approach to truly understand a society.
A355PGLV2ID2SX	essay3	They are some useful to the Scandals
A359ETX78LN74M	essay1	While it's true that at times technology may solve problems for humans, it will also enable humans to expand their horizons and consider more complex problems. Just because technology is used doesn't mean it will erase a person's ability to solve that problem themselves. For example, I regularly use a calculator to add large numbers, but that doesn't mean I'm unable to do that addition myself. I am just freeing up time to think about more complex issues and get more things done. I don't need to do menial tasks that technology can do for me. Technology can be used as an asset to consider deeper and more complicated issues, enabling humans to accomplish even more.
A359ETX78LN74M	essay2	Major cities will definitely give a good insight into a society. It is, however, an incomplete picture. Large cities are politically and culturally very different from smaller towns and rural areas. These differences should be considered with determining major characteristics of a society. Things that are more prevalent in cities might be quite rare in most rural areas. Major cities are a valuable tool for understanding a society, but it would be in error to only look at those areas.
A359ETX78LN74M	essay3	Scandals are sometimes a useful way to catch the public's attention, but sometimes they are overly salacious and distract from the real problems. Things may be worthy of our attention even if they don't become a widespread scandal. Some issues are swept under the rug and we need to pay attention to those things too. It's important to pay mind to scandals in news, but don't let them consume all of your attention and distract you from other issues.  Stay vigilant of all issues.
A35NM2285DUAFH	essay1	Having technology is definitely a boon for humans but I think it is important to note that robots are only capable of doing what we allow them to do. There may be many things that we as humans just choose not to program robots to do. I believe that there will always be things that we just need humans to do and even though having robots will make a lot of our tasks much more efficient and quicker, I do not believe this will result in overall lower intelligence.   Consider that using AI assistance to quickly accomplish a goal, like directions for instance, actually allows us to more quickly accomplish what we are trying to do. Robots will always be there to assist us and never to take over for us. It is not like the robot will automatically be planning out our days and telling us what we need to do. We will always be making those choices for ourselves.  Having computers help us makes us smarter and more efficient and because of this, we ultimately end up being smarter because we can manage our time better.
A35NM2285DUAFH	essay2	I don't think that this is necessarily true. I think that focusing on smaller communities and seeing how we react in a more personal type of situation can we truly understand the most important characteristics of society. How we work together, how we form friendships, how we are willing to sacrifice for each other and how we are able to uphold justice when faced when convicting a friend. Larger cities I feel are more unfriendly and you miss that more personal, intimate type of feeling that I believe is important to who we are as people and what ultimately shapes our society.  Building large cities and creating fantastical infrastructures is not who we are as a society. What makes us who we are is how we interact with each other. If you really want to see the most important characteristics, you really need to focus on the smaller communities where people live and die together. The people relying on each other for survival.  This is where you find everything you need to know.
A35NM2285DUAFH	essay3	I think this is kind of true. But consider for a moment that scandals really just force an issue into daylight when any other time, no one really wants to talk about it.   Imagine that a friend of yours is cheating on his wife. Normally, no one would ever talk about why this is happening. He probably would not be trying to fix things with his wife. He would just bury the problem and continue cheating. Now imagine that he has been caught and everyone knows about it. He is now confronted with the reality that he has to talk about his marriage problems because he is being forced to.   Look, the problem was always there no matter the subject but no one wants to talk about it until they don't have a choice. Perhaps we need to stop worrying so much and start confronting problems now before they end up becoming 'scandals'. A scandal in my view is a problem that is now forced to be dealt with. It was always a problem, but now everyone knows about it.
A362CV8OOYJA6W	essay1	Technology has come a way in a short order of time.  One one hand it makes things so much easier for people with disabilities.  On the other hand we rely on it to do the must basic things.  This biggest one would be math.  We are so quick to get on our phone to add something simple up and we don't take the time to think things through.  In a way I feel it makes kids and people lazier.
A362CV8OOYJA6W	essay2	Living in a major city has great benefits for many people.  You will have access to better schools, jobs, stores and medical care.  If is also an advantage for people without a car.  The use of public transportation is really in need.  People can still support themselves and provide for the families.  The housing and choices are better too.
A362CV8OOYJA6W	essay3	"When it comes to scandals and the media I like to ignore it.  I feel that news programs use it as a filler space when they have no actually news to report.  I honesestly don't care what star sleep with who or who had the latest baby.  People feed off this stuff and tend to run with facts that aren't true.  We should focus some time on ""good news: stories in the local community."
A36D7P81YSP3VZ	essay1	Technology has helped many businesses become successful and save time, money and energy. Most technological advances have served to make life more convenient and enjoyable and improve service quality to customers. These are all good reasons for technology and its constant development. For example, strides in health care have now allowed for heart surgery to be completed through the help of robotics. The  robot helps surgeons complete invasive surgery, which cannot be completed precisely by human hands. Businesses should continue to reevaluate technology and stay on the cutting edge in order to provide up-to-date services and products to clients.

A36D7P81YSP3VZ	essay3	Although technology is used to help solve problems such as convenience issues, budget constraints and increase program effectiveness, it can also cause headaches. For example, how many times have you called a hotline only to be passed on from one automated message to another when you have a question for a live representative? This could present as a challenge, even though it was meant to mainstream and make the process more efficient for callers and representatives. Businesses that use technology should continue to reevaluate the need for the certain technology. The technology should bring something to the company and consumer. The need for the technology in making or enhancing services should match the need of the consumer.
A3749CB7HBP2WR	essay1	I agree with this statement. Everyday there is a new type of app that comes up that helps you to be lazier for each and every simple task you have to perform. You have things that can track what you eat, your daily schedule. Not only that, but you can have things set to a timer, where they happen automatically and you don't even have to set up. In addition to these apps, there have been robots, in a sense, released. For example, Amazon's Alexa robot. You can have her do a plethora of things for you. You just talk to her and she sets up whatever you want. You can order things off amazon, check the weather, call someone. She is literally a personal assistant in a tiny machine. Every time you hear about a new piece of technology, you typically hear about something that can make your life even easier than it already is. People don't even need to go to libraries anymore, or the store. If you need information, with a few clicks you can access information that you could find in over a thousand libraries. In regards to the store comment, if you need to buy something for your household, you can buy it at an onlien shop. For school? Buy it online and get it delivered. You can have food delivered to your house that you bought online too. You can even work from home. You literally don't have to leave your house for anything because you can even pay your bills on
A3749CB7HBP2WR	essay2	I disagree with this statement because I believe the true heart of a society lies within the smaller, tight-knit communities. While the major cities are the ones that thrive the most and have the most liveliness to them, it isn't everything. These major cities aren't just for that one society, these cities usually appeal to people all around the world, which means that this city is most likely a melting pot of cultures. If you take Los Angeles for example, there is not one type of person in LA. There are so many people from all over the world. LA also has its own unique culture created by all these other cultures, too. However, most of California is nothing like LA. I would know this because I am from there. Major cities are usually unique in their own way, different from society. While these major cities have a lot of personality  to them, what is contained inside them would not necessarily be specific to one society. So, I think to learn about important aspects of a society, one must go to the smaller cities in order to see how people truly live and act.
A3749CB7HBP2WR	essay3	Scandals, to me, are the opposite of useful because they detract our attention from actual problems. For example, people continuously talk about President Trump's scandals, but how many people are actually focusing on his politics? Not that many because they're too busy talking about what porn star he slept with or some other paltry thing. If you really think about it, why does any of this matter? People are always going to gossip because they like to bring a person down, which is why a scandal can be so entertaining. A scandal is much more entertaining to the public than the possibility of a politician or anyone else doing their job correctly and well. Sometimes these scandals can bring to light issues that are important, like how everyone in Hollywood is committing sexual assault. This is good because this is in no way acceptable and it should be stopped. However, I don't think it's right either because then you have people who accuse actors falsely of sexual assault just to get their fifteen minutes of fame. They can get this fifteen minutes of fame because of how much emphasis people put on scandals. The public has gotten to the point where they treat a scandal like hot juicy gossip, or a chance to take advantage of someone, not, oh, this scandal has really made me realize that this is wrong. In truth, scandals take away attention from actual issues at hand.
A37AWU2VH1ZIXX	essay1	 People are becoming mentally dumb since technology does everything for them. People now use calculators instead of figuring out math problems. Peopl google search answers without reading. People look to the internet to do almost everything for them nowadays. Technology is suppose to solve problems but it is becoming a problem.
A37AWU2VH1ZIXX	essay2	One must see how people live, thrive, and get along to see what characteristics one has in a society. In a city you can see many people of different cultures and upbringings socialize. You can see how close people live and how they attain food. You can tell how people get along when you see them in action in cities. Cities can be burdensome or they can be productive.
A37AWU2VH1ZIXX	essay3	Scandals can be useful in that its gets people to talk to one another. Everyone enjoys a scandle and talking about how, when, and why something happens. Scandals gives us an okay to talk about taboo things. Scandals are like a dirty secret of things that do happen but no one talks about.
A37BBKFZU9BINN	essay1	"I agree that people are getting lazier about thinking as technology makes life easier. I first noticed this in my high school math classes over twenty years ago. We were required to buy pricey calculators to do our Algebra 2 work. I always wondered how I would learn anything other than how to type numbers into a calculator. I left the class feeling very unfulfilled...and I've forgotten how to use that fancy graphing calculator. In similar ways, people have gotten lazy about proper spelling and grammar thanks to the popularity of texting, as well as reliance on spell checkers. And then we have the media...people adopt the biases of the news anchors instead of listening critically and weeding out the antagonizing biases to find the facts. Now we have the rise of what I call ""thought police"" among young college students. Soon, any unapproved speech or thoughts will leave people shunned and blackballed from society. I love technology, but it is not always beneficial to our mental or cognitive health."
A37BBKFZU9BINN	essay2	"I disagree. One of my pet peeves is the common joke about ""flyover states"" within the United States. I think that to dismiss a huge chunk of the nation as being unworthy of notice is intellectually lazy. In many ways, the most important characteristics of our own society lie within those midwestern areas that so many self-proclaimed cosmopolitan travelers would ignore. We certainly cannot judge the people of the smaller towns or more rural, (or even suburban,) areas by the ways and thoughts of city dwellers. The differences are so great, that if we use the cities as examples of a society, the rest of society would be totally ignored. In fact, this is the same reasoning behind our electoral college. The needs and experiences of people living in major cities have little in common with the rest of the people of a nation."
A37BBKFZU9BINN	essay3	Scandals are useful for little more than selling advertising space in tabloid magazines or on sketchy websites. They don't focus our attention on meaningful problems. Instead, they distract us from the serious problems that should hold our attention. Scandals are like gossip; they should be shut down with serious and practical behavior and words. Sometimes a scandal will show as a sign of a larger problem, but still, the single scandal should not be our focus--the big picture should be. Most of the time scandals are used to bully or embarrass a competitor rather than as a means to improve society. Not unlike negative campaign ads.
A37DTVGS7RX6AG	essay1	I do think that while technology is very valuable in solving problems, it has drawbacks.  People begin to rely on technology more than their own problem solving skills.  Think about a simple calculator.  If you depend on it too much, you will find yourself barely able to do simple calculations in your head.  People need to be able to problem solve without always depending on technology.  Also, errors may be contained in technology answers so you may trust these answers without realizing their shortcomings.  We need to be able to make judgements on the validity of information ourselves.
A37DTVGS7RX6AG	essay2	Major cities offer a great cross section of society.  Many groups are represented such as poor, wealthy, ethnic, young and old just to name a few.  By comparing these groups, we are able to identify important characteristics that are part of these groups.  We are also able to identify different characteristics.  The groups within these major cities function as little societies for research purposes.  What characteristics meld well together and which ones do not.  How these groups solve problems for the cities by working together can be observed.
A37DTVGS7RX6AG	essay3	Scandals wake us up to things that are possible that we might not have imagined.  Scandals in themselves are surprising because we did not expect them.  They get our attention.  We can look at ways to head these scandals off by identifying methods to repair the root cause.  We can identify ways to help people who are victims of scandals based on their experiences.  A healing process can be developed for these victims so that future victims won't be as afflicted.
A37JA32OJCPHML	essay1	As people rely on technology their ability to think for themselves will deteriorate. Of course, this is axiomatically true. When a task is taken over by a piece of technology, humans brains no longer process the information in the same way. Consider an historical example. The advent of writing led to the a decline in memory. Oral tradition fell to writing as the latter increased in importance.  This seems like a doomed proposition for humans. Our brains are less important as we rely on technology to think for us. But of course, this is not what happens. As we well know, as technology replaces tasks for humans, brain capacity is freed up for other pursuits. Our minds no longer have to dwell upon the mundane and we can use the capacity for other things. This is
A37JA32OJCPHML	essay2	In order to understand a society you must study major cities. It isn't hard to see why. Major cities contain a massive amount of people. Thus, a large percentage of a society exists in a major city. One can get an accurate cross-section of society from this one, relatively small, geographic location.  At the same time, concentrating on cities ignores the vast amount of land in a society. In rural areas, culture springs from the earth. This leads to situations where people leave the cities and enter the countryside for renewal. Ignoring the area outside of cities will allow a cross section of contemporary society. But it will lack the authenticity that the rural area provides.
A37JA32OJCPHML	essay3	Scandals are useful because they draw our attention to problems that would otherwise get ignored. Talking and discussing issues only leads so far. A scandal tears aside the curtains of subterfuge and shines the light of justice upon the dark corners of society.  However, scandals are indicative of deep, moral issues in a society. They might be useful in exposing problems but their mere existence is evidence of further issues. A scandal-free society is preferable to one with scandals, even if they draw attention in a way that no speaker or reformer ever could.
A37VBAMFEQKJO4	essay1	I see it everyday with my kids and their friends.  The ability for younger people to communicate is quickly deteriorating.  They will all be seated around a table with their noses buried in their phones.  Not one of them will look up.  No conversations at all.  They may glance at each other and smile, but silence abounds. How are they to form critical thinking skills if they can't communicate.  The ability to think for themselves is moving towards group think over the internet.  It is a scary future.
A37VBAMFEQKJO4	essay2	Look at the cities to fully understand what the society values most.  It is obvious in most modern cities that wealth is held to high esteem.  Our most weak and vulnerable citizens are cast to the shadows.  Praise the dollar and hide the poor.  The few who decide to help those who can't help themselves are the true heroes of the modern age.  We all need to look deep within ourselves and decide what matters most
A37VBAMFEQKJO4	essay3	"In the immortal words of our Democratic leaders, ""Never let a good scandal go to waste"".  Scandals  have a habit of bringing us together.  While we may all disagree on the reasons why, we can all agree to the final solution.  A scandal gives us all a focal point to help us all come together.  We all feel similar emotions.  That in itself is the glue that binds us during a scandal."
A37YQMBY6CX2CB	essay1	Inventing what the world needs- that is now Edison described the crux of innovation in technology. Big problems represent even bigger opportunities. To quote famous Canadian ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky, who scored many hits in his time, the trick is not to “skate where the puck is,” but to “skate where the puck is going.” Building a business or solving social problems with technology. Technology has come up with most scalable solutions which can impact business across the world.  Whether it is clean energy, robotics, quantum computing, synthetic biology, telemedicine, AI, or cloud education and NUI software, technology can solve all the biggest problems confronting mankind. Creating value means coming up with something people will pay for in the real world. Virtual technologies can open up a window of possibilities, given their widespread application. Starting small but thinking big…that is the key to using modern technology to solve the biggest problems in modern day existence.
A37YQMBY6CX2CB	essay2	In today's Contemporary and fast paced world, each country's major cities play a very important role in  deciding the economic, social as well as political status of a country. The major cities reflect upon the  overall development and provide a bird's view of that country. However, this is an unfair generalization  made by the author that looking into the major cities will give us all the important characteristics of a  society. Let’s further look into this.  For decades, a country has been divided into two fragments. Firstly, the major cities where  Urbanization and development have taken at a faster pace. Secondly the towns and rural areas of the  country which provide a closer look into the cultural heritage. The major cities have helped in establishing international standards and maintaining the foreign relations. Every major city of any country will always have the best amenities and  and facilities be it New Delhi in India, Paris in France or Beijing in China. However these cities may provide some insight into the culture and traditions of that country ,their socioeconomic status and the way their society functions but will not give a holistic picture. Due to Commercialization and the growing needs of each city to compete with each other in the race of being the best, they somewhat are not capable of capturing the true essence of their society and the bucolic beauty of that nation.
A37YQMBY6CX2CB	essay3	“Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.” Scandals sometimes can catch public’s attention, and shed light on some issues that may be controversial and worth attention. However, I disagree with the statement that scandals can focus people’s attention on problems in ways that no speaker and reformer ever could, because it is possible that some speakers and reformers can focus public’s attention effectively just like scandals do, and scandals may not always focus public’s attention in a useful way.
A3862RIFFUV141	essay1	I think this has already shown to be true.  We rely so heavily on information from the internet that we are really starting to just go there upon habit rather than rely on our minds.  I mean obviously we need to go there for things we don't know but I think people retain less information than they used to simply because they realize that at anytime they can hop online and get any piece of information they need about something.  This is especially true for when they have a problem.  I think people's first instinct rather than try and think of a solution is to simply go online and look up a way to solve their problem.  The more we rely on this the more we don't have to think for ourselves.  It's become a habit or second nature to not think for ourselves and we are seeing this more and more in society.
A3862RIFFUV141	essay2	Well I certainly think studying the major cities makes it easier to understand society because of the shier vastness of major cities but I don't think it's necessary.  Nor do I think you can learn everything there is to know just by looking at major cities.  You would lose important aspects of society that are only found in smaller cities or rural town.  Functioning societies are very dependent on areas beyond major cities.  So really in order to grasp all the important characteristics of society you have to look at the whole picture and not just the major cities to really understand how society works.
A3862RIFFUV141	essay3	I think they are equal useful but certainly scandals aren't the only way to get attention onto problems though arguably they are often the most effect way of doing so.  Take Flint Michigan and their clean water problems.  Much of that was caused by corruption but it's safe to say their water quality wasn't good before they took some short cuts.  It's also made people aware of the fact that there's many other cities where the quality of the water is as bad or worse than Flint.  So yes it definitely can help to shed a light on issues that normally stay hidden.
A38DXFI1TZA295	essay1	I think that's it's very true and absolutely correct that relying on technology can inhibit thinking in certain areas. Technology is a boon in many areas, there's no doubt about that, but it can lead to people living on autopilot in many areas as well. I used to know all my friend's phone numbers by heart before I had a cell and smartphone. But now I couldn't tell you any single number of a friend other than my parents home phone line which has been the same my entire life. The constant barrage of slanted and fake news that technology and social media puts in people's hands in other places where critical thinking is really diminished. People just accept it because it's on their app, their feed or their wall. No one takes time to really think about how plausible or implausible the story really is wh
A38DXFI1TZA295	essay2	I don't think major cities are a good reflection of a society. It's most often where the most crime and most debauchery are found, although that might be some indication where a society is headed. I think that a true reflection of a society is the people that you find in the more rural and suburban areas. These are the people who work hard, build, and create. I think they are a much better reflection of everyday life. Big cities are so crowded and people are so tense that they are often not themselves. They act out in ways that are atypical of their true nature. It's not until they get away from this stress that they really show their inner self.
A38DXFI1TZA295	essay3	I think it's very sad if you depend on a scandal to show you the problems that you face. I know it's human nature to rubberneck for an accident or watch a race just for the crashes, but why should that same attitude apply to problems in a community. People need to listen to the ones trying to bring about change or reform to issues that are troubling, instead of looking toward the trouble. When something turns into a scandal, it's already gone too far. It's better to put out a small blaze than wait until it turns into a raging inferno to me. Listening to speakers and reformers should be a priority, not an afterthought.

A38VMTKS30TQZB	essay1	I don't think this is true. Technology has become more and more of a complement to the human lifestyle. If anything, technology is helping humans think more and more for themselves. The sheer amount of information that we have at our fingertips allows for more intelligent humans, and more points of view. We can readily see both sides of an issue. This can help us make better decisions. We are  amplifying ourselves with technology.
A38VMTKS30TQZB	essay2	I agree with this issue. Major cities are the epicenters of most societies. This is where you can see the latest societal trends. This is where you can see the diversity of a society. You can see the most extreme highs and the most extreme societal lows in a major city. When you pack a lot of people into a small area, you get a little bit of everything. Major cities typically shape our media and laws, two of the most important things for determining societal characteristics.
A38VMTKS30TQZB	essay3	I agree with this. We are a very news and media driven society. Scandals help bring attention to and unite people on various issues. People then speak up and try to enact change. This has been effective throughout history. In a free society, the people are the ones that drive change. While speakers and reformers have their place, scandals find more common ground.
A39C210BKD7YNN	essay1	I think that the statement is definitely true. I am proof that I do less now than I used to, before technology. For example, they have voice to text programs now, so I don't have to type out anything..i just speak and the computer types it for me.  In earlier times, even the calculator made it easier for people to do math, without even thinking about it.  So imagine how far technology has came since the calculator, and you'll realize that everything that used to take a lot of time and thinking can now most likely be done simply by clicking a few buttons.  I think that with robotics advancing, many people might even be out of jobs in the near future, and computers will be doing all of the thinking for us.
A39C210BKD7YNN	essay2	I think this is very untrue. I live in New York City, but I grew up in a small town in Illinois.  Most of the big cities today are very liberal, democratic cities.  As you can see from the election, most American's voted for Republicans and they still support the conservative values.  They value hard work, religion, traditional marriage, and traditional families.  That's what a happy life is all about, in my opinion. When you go into big cities, it's as if they don't care about the things that made America great from the beginning. As stated in the news recently, major cities in California are turning into big messes, full of illegal aliens, drug addicts, and crime.  You only see that in the big, democratic cities. Chicago for instance, is the crime capital of the country, and it's run by democrats. Nobody supports a conservative way of life there.
A39C210BKD7YNN	essay3	I believe this is being proven to be true every day, with the Russian collusion story.  When it first started a year ago, the fake news media made it sound like Donald Trump was running a huge scam, and it was going to be the biggest scandal in political history. Now, one year and ten million dollars later, they still haven't proven any collusion, but yet we are finding out every day something bad that the democrats have done in the previous administration to get the President out of office. They never thought he would beat Hillary. When he did, they made plans to bring him down.  Due to the democrats starting the Russian Collusion scandal, we are now focusing on what's REALLY happening, and the truth is starting to come out.
A39DNHD26OMN4Q	essay1	The idea that people's reliance on technology will cause a decline in humanities ability to think for themselves is preposterous. Humans will always be able to think for themselves, they will just adapt to new circumstances, and those who do not will be left behind. It's simple Darwinism. There will always be a need for humans to think for themselves, after all who will be programing this new technology? Humans will. To suggest otherwise is to fear the future, and that will cause a sharp decline in new innovations and that will be what causes humanities mental cognition to deteriorate.
A39DNHD26OMN4Q	essay2	If one were to study a macro view of society one should study the behavior of humanity in a major city. But it is not necessary to do this in order to understand the most important aspects of society. A complete study of society should include swaths of small towns and rural areas as well as major cities. Studying one part of society as a whole will only lead to faulty data, because it is guaranteed that the way society functions in a small rural town will vastly differ from a major city. In order to discover the most important characteristics of society one must look for common points of similarity in all sorts of smaller societies asa
A39DNHD26OMN4Q	essay3	For the Trump administration the idea that scandals are useful because they divert attention holds true. One scandal might look bad, but the Trump administration is playing a whole new ball game. They use hundreds of scandals to divert attention from it's criminal activity, and those scandals never make much of an impact because there's another one around the corner. Compare this to the Obama administrations 8 year term. People hardly focused on them because they were competent, clean, honest people. Politics were boring then. Now we've got a clown in the oval office creating scandals and we can't look away. What will he say next? What will he do? Obama rode under the radar, while Trump flies over the moon thanks to his numerous scandals.
A3A8P4UR9A0DWQ	essay1	As people rely more on the advancements that we have in our world today when it pertains to technology they depend on it to give the answers that they seek. They no longer use deductive reasoning or logistical skills in problem solving. Need an answer to a question? Just look it up and the answer is at your fingertips without having even had to put thought into it. This is a disturbing occurrence in our world today. We are no longer taught the reason behind math for instance, but to just come up with an answer. We are told how to think by those online or those that we perceive to know more than we do. We rely on technology to produce our answers. When thinking about telling time for instance we no longer rely on the suns position but on digital clocks that just give an answer without any thought on our behalf.
A3A8P4UR9A0DWQ	essay2	Cities are the heartbeat of a country. How they run and what motivates the citizens also impacts those in rural areas. Major cities are where thought, art, ideas, ingenuity and learning take place. Businesses thrive and people have opportunities to grow in careers and in other areas. As cities make policy decisions others in other areas follow. The city is like the central hub from where everything else flows. It may be because of the sheer number of people who live in cities can contribute to society in a variety of ways.
A3A8P4UR9A0DWQ	essay3	When scandals happen people have their attention placed on a topic that they may not have thought of. As scandals then unfold people continue to watch and learn and then their thoughts are formed by their own opinion of the situation. Many scandals have gone down in history and people remember those rather than just dates on a page. It is easier to follow the human than a specific time in history. This is what makes a great story to follow and is why tabloids are big business. Everyone is intrigued by a juicy scandal. Talking heads will bring news everyday and people glaze over but put out some risky story and people are all eyes and ears.
A3AIX82WZQZB5A	essay1	I think that it is certainly true that as people depend more on technology that it makes them harder for them to do things for themselves.  When you always have something do something for you, you tend to forget how to do it or how to have the problem skills to handle it on your own.  For instance if you always use a calculator to do math, if you forget your calculator and have to do things right then you might have a harder time remembering how to do something or it would take you much longer. I use a excel sheet to do my bills, I have everything listed I just add the numbers and it shows me how much money I have left etc.  If I did  not use that next month I would  not have all the previous information from other months there and would not have all the amounts and due dates available to me right then. I would have to go through all my paper bills write out a list and add it all manually which would take me much longer  As technology thinks for us more and more we lose the sharpness that we once had.  Technology makes things easier for us which might cause at times for us to become lazier.
A3AIX82WZQZB5A	essay2	I agree to learn more about society you need to study the characteristics of major cities.  They would be the most populated so you would have a bigger group to study on.  You would see  a bigger variety in people and the jobs they do and also how they behave.  If you were to do a very small town with only a few people it would not give you a wide enough number of people to study.  As you study major cities you will see how people have things in common and how they do things different.  It will give you a better idea of how people live and why they do the things they do.  You would have more number of peoples and be able to learn more about them.
A3AIX82WZQZB5A	essay3	I think that scandals are useful in certain situations because it gives us a heads up on things that we might have never known before.  It opens up discussion and also ways to prevent it and help people once it has happened.  For instance the Me To movement when the first people came out it brought light to the fact of sexual harassment is happening.  It gave women a voice and  also strength to come out and know they are not alone.  I think that when a scandal breaks sometimes people can get relief and know that other people have gone through the same thing and that they are not alone. Scandals help make laws and procedures to stop it from happening to others from the future and prevent other people from experiencing the same thing.  Scandals can be very hurtful and devastating but also could help someone who is suffering.
A3AV8KOZW78IEW	essay1	I fully agree with this statement. People don't need to know how to do much of anything anymore. All they have to do is ask Google and they will be given the answer to the question. Children nowadays have no idea what a Dictionary or an Encyclopedia is, Most kids havent even been in a public library to do any research. We as a society have become entirely too dependent on technology.
A3AV8KOZW78IEW	essay2	I tend to agree with this. Most major cities are melting pots of all kind of different people from different countries. They are a mix of different religions and beliefs. And for the most part, we exist in harmony. To undersatnd society as a whole, you must learn about all different religions and beliefs, and large cities are a great resource for that.
A3AV8KOZW78IEW	essay3	I disagree. Scandals can bring to light important topics, but they also are usually forgotten by the time the next scandal comes along. Nothing ever is really resolved by a scandal. The media runs with it for a while, until something more juicy comes along, and then it's onto the next thing. Scandals are really just another form of entertainment for the general public.
A3BUWQ5C39GRQC	essay1	I believe that as people rely more on technology to solve problems, their ability to think for themselves deteriorate. There was an article once where I read that when it comes to memory, people no longer remember the actual fact. They remember how to get to the information. Like when it comes to remembering when something happen like world war 2. Instead of people thinking and remembering the date, they are more likely to remember how to use google to get to the answer quickly. And it does happen to me. Know when trying to remember a recipe, I can't but I do remember what website I found the recipe at.
A3BUWQ5C39GRQC	essay2	I think that to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study major cities. When it comes to research, sample size is very important. And cities are the places with the highest population. It would be easier to extrapolate data when there is a huge amount of people. For example, if one wants to study how children learn. Places with low population and no variety will not give one enough information to understand how children learn. Or if one wants to understand the causes of weight gain, cities will give one a higher sample size to really understand.
A3BUWQ5C39GRQC	essay3	Scandals are not useful because they tend to distract our attention from problems. While people are paying attention to the scandal and arguing among themselves, they allow themselves to be distracted about what is actually the problem. For example, celebrity scandals, cause people to break out in teams on which side they are, but ignore what the scandal is about. Like when Chris  Brown hit his girlfriend Rihanna. Instead of discussing the implications of physical abuse, people want to talk about if the person deserved and who they supported. Even to this day people don't seem to care and still buy his music.
A3C1U769G160ZE	essay1	"As people rely more on technology to do their thinking for them, our ability to do our own thinking deteriorates.  We see this now with younger generations that have grown up with technology.  Their spelling and grammar skills are lacking due to the reliance on spell check.  Handwriting skills are significantly decreased.  My son is 15 years old and cannot read cursive or sign his name.  As technology advances and our homes become ""smarter"" we become dumber.  I no longer have to remember my keys or get up from the couch to see who is at the door.  My door lock is operated from my smart phone and the doorbell just indicates I need to look at my phone to view my front door camera.  My car makes many decisions for me.  It warns me if I'm departing my lane, it stops the car for me if I'm approaching an object too quickly.  If there is on object behind me it beeps at me more insistently.  I don't have to look over my shoulder to see if there's a car next to me because it will light up and warn me if there is.  These conveniences are wonderful until I am driving a car without this technology and can't remember how to turn on my own headlights.  I think we must work hard to enjoy the technological advances but also remember how to do things ourselves."
A3C1U769G160ZE	essay2	I do agree that some of the most important characteristics of a society can be located in its major cities.  You will find the most diversity here and some of the most advanced thought.  The reason for this is great minds often seek those that they can collaborate or share with.  The most likely place to find others like oneself are in areas of large populations.  This can be found in the major cities.  You will find artists and scientists and history in major cities in a way you cannot find on such a large scale in smaller or more rural areas.  The more rural areas are more cut off from society and open discussion with a diverse population and less likely to have adapted to the way things are current done.
A3C1U769G160ZE	essay3	While I do wish that scandals did not exist and that everyone conducted themselves with morals and scruples and played by the rules, the sad reality is this not often the case.  When scandals are brought to light it accomplishes a couple of things.  Firstly, it brings awareness to the issue.  Secondly, it deters other wrongdoers with the fear of publicity a public outing of their misdeeds would bring.    Public awareness leads to discussion.  It can lead to public outcry on how and why these things are happening.  This outcry can lead to reform.  This benefits society by making the world a slightly better place than it was before.  This cannot be accomplished by someone talking AT you.  There is a difference between hearing about something that may be a problem and seeing the problem in action.    Fear of public shame can be a powerful deterrent.  There will always be those who seek to do wrong for personal gain, however, the possibility of being outed can make them think twice before they act wrongly.
A3D1VTLX623K6I	essay1	I think the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate as people rely more on technology to solve problems holds true for some people.  There is always a group of people that look for the easy way out, a way to do the least amount of work and having technology solve their problems for them will be very appealing.  Conversely, there is always a group of people who will want to take care of the problem themselves, even if they aren't sure they have the skills to tackle the problem.  And then there is the group in the middle, probably the largest group, that doesn't feel that technology should do everything but also doesn't know how to solve the problems themselves.  Of course, the technology is only as smart and advanced as the people who programmed it, so there is always the possibility that technology can't solve the problems and it will need human help.
A3D1VTLX623K6I	essay2	I do not believe that to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.  Characteristics vary from locale to locale, so what may be characteristic in one cities, is totally uncharacteristic in another city.  Rural areas may offer characteristics that aren't seen as often in cities, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.  I think this is a case when the whole is greater than the parts.  If you want to understand the most important characteristics of a society, you must study the entire society, in all its locations to get a true overview.  If you study society on a city by city basis, you are getting no more than a snapshot of society, not the whole picture.
A3D1VTLX623K6I	essay3	Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on things we would have never known about otherwise.  Scandals are things that have been brought to light, that people were trying to keep covered.  Scandals are never about good things, they are always about something bad.  If scandals weren't brought forward, people with bad intentions would run through society unchecked.  Most people don't believe a random speaker or reformer, but a whistle blower leaking a scandal is always noticed.
A3D9L5CQXK1YJL	essay1	It has already become evident in society that the ability of human beings to think for themselves is deteriorating. Try to get the proper change from a cashier if the cash register does not display it for them. A personal experience for me was when a storm knocked the power out and I wanted coffee from a convenience store. The clerk said nothing could be sold because the registers were not working. I asked how much a large coffee was with tax, then gave that amount in cash. For other products, it would be difficult for them to sell as they need a working computer to even know the cost of the products.
A3D9L5CQXK1YJL	essay2	The fundamental characteristics of a given society could partially, but not fully, be explored by studying their major cities. The infrastructure for the cities that would remain as archeological evidence would suggest abilities ot work together, but would not demonstrate much of the humanitarian side of a society. The pinnacle of societies is often considered to be large cities. However, the really important characteristics of a society are its fundamentals of care for all citizens, not just urban dwellers. To get a clearer picture, rural and small towns would have ot be studied too.
A3D9L5CQXK1YJL	essay3	Scandals usually represent the symptoms of problems rather then the core issues that are the causative factors for the problems. The MeToo movement is women standing up to declare the horrific abuses they have suffered trying to make their way in American society. However, dragging the perpetrators of these crimes into the sunlight does not correct the cause. It only causes the rest of the predators to crawl further into the shadows to lie in wait until the scandals die down. The issues that lead to these criminal perpetrators rising to positions of authority need to be rectified to protect future generations of women.
A3DAJROQC1BLNI	essay1	The ability to look things up online has eliminated to a large degree the need to remember things, it's true. I'm not a plumber but I was able to fix my own garbage disposal thanks to google. However, there are several important steps which had to be taken which to me, definitely counter this idea. First, I had to know which questions to ask. I had to know what kind of disposal I had, and think through how the problem happened. I had to search through a sea of answers to determine the ones I wanted to try, and I had to determine how to go about doing the things I was told to do. When they didn't work, I had to reevaluate the process and look for a new answer. I would say that rather than thinking for myself less, the ability to look this up encouraged me to try to understand things I would have, decades ago, thought beyond my ken. Technology opens doors. It doesn't close them.
A3DAJROQC1BLNI	essay2	There are stories about great monks, zen masters of serenity who spend their lives in meditation in caves or high on mountains. These stories talk about how calm they are, and how accepting. They live above and apart from the cares of most of their society. Then they go to the city, where there is noise, and crowding, and people bump against them, yell over them, walk into them, and all serenity is gone. The sharp edges of a person are revealed in a city, as are the edges of the society a people build. People also tend to place the things they deem important for most to have access to in cities. You put what you value most where the most people can reach it, so going to a society's city would show you what those valued things are.
A3DAJROQC1BLNI	essay3	Scandals, for the most part, take a real problem and turn it into entertainment. While it may indeed give the problem greater prominence to most people, it doesn't do so in a productive way.  People become wrapped up in pointing fingers, judging, laughing, following the story, and not in looking for solutions. When a real problem is wrapped inside a conversation piece, the root of the problem is lost. Plus there's always a side of people who don't want the problem to end as long as they're enjoying it. Scandals highlight the wrong things, and slow reform down. Putting the focus on the problem and not the finger-pointing is the way to true reform.
A3DHJDGGSPEI0O	essay1	I agree with the statement. I believe this to be the case because I myself could say I've suffered the consequences of relying on technology too much. That is not to say technology hasn't helped in advancing many things. For example, I would never say a calculator is bad because calculators of many kinds have been used to solve many problems. However, there is a limit. I remember when I went to school and all throughout college, we were never allowed to have phones in class. Now it's the standard and there are teachers who even encourage the use of phones in class. Kids can literally copy and paste their questions into google and receive answers or answer sheets to their classwork. There are programs which solve algebraic equations easily, unlike before when a good understand of the program was needed to even use it. People are just using their phones and being fed the opinions and supposed facts of the big tech companies. I would like to give people more credit, but people just believe the first thing they see and don't think about questioning it. If all the answers to every problem can be found online then what motivation is there to so
A3DHJDGGSPEI0O	essay2	I disagree. A major city is not representative of society as a whole. You can't analyze society without studying the characteristics of cities or societies of all sizes. An example of this on a smaller scale and how it could have an erroneous effect is seen by the recent election for example. The majority of people in a populated state voted for a certain candidate. If there was no electoral college, then that state's ideals and interests would have completely overridden those of places with smaller populations who are geographically in different areas, different ways of thinking, different upbringings. It would be an error to judge a whole country by the beliefs of society in a large city only. I can understand why they would, it'd be more efficient, but it would not be representative of a society as a whole. Maybe of a society yes...if you'd wanted to know about a specific city, but even then you cannot compare all large cities because of their histories, geographical location, etc.
A3DHJDGGSPEI0O	essay3	I don't agree. I think that scandals are picked and chosen by those in power. Sometimes scandals do expose the truth, but is it fair to just make a scandal by purposely misunderstanding or purposely choosing what to make a scandal because it's part of your agenda? So I don't think all scandals are useful. Another way of thinking about it is that some scandals are useful, but they don't get the attention they should or are simply swept under the rug because it isn't convenient. Take the NSA scandal for example, it was not new that the government could spy on people in that way. It's stuff that has been known and made public before. Did the NSA scandal reach the level it should have? No. But it's funny, if you had talked about the details of the NSA stuff BEFORE the scandal, you would have been labeled a conspiracy theorist. Even today you could talk about the same scandal and people pretend to be ignorant and still say you're crazy. Everything is controlled by those in power, just like the levels that scandals reach and thats most apparent in this presidential administration.
A3DJ2UFRYVU0EC	essay1	"Shapes of physical objects are equal if the subsets of space these objects occupy satisfy the definition above. In particular, the shape does not depend on the size and placement in space of the object. For instance, a ""d"" and a ""p"" have the same shape, as they can be perfectly superimposed if the ""d"" is translated to the right by a given distance, rotated upside down and magnified by a given factor (see Procrustes superimposition for details). However, a mirror image could be called a different shape. For instance, a ""b"" and a ""p"" have a different shape, at least when they are constrained to move within a two-dimensional space like the page on which they are written. Even though they have the same size, there's no way to perfectly superimpose them by translating and rotating them along the page. Similarly, within a three-dimensional space, a right hand and a left hand have a different shape, even if they are the mirror images of each other. Shapes may change if the object is scaled non-uniformly. For example, a sphere becomes an ellipsoid when scaled differently in the vertical and horizontal directions. In other words, preserving axes of symmetry (if they exist) is important for preserving shapes. Also, shape is determined by only the outer boundary of an object."
A3DJ2UFRYVU0EC	essay2	n motorsport the pole position is the position at the inside of the front row at the start of a racing event. This position is typically given to the vehicle and driver with the best qualifying time in the trials before the race (the leader in the starting grid). This number-one qualifying driver is referred to as the pole sitter.
A3DJ2UFRYVU0EC	essay3	its work is i like it.
A3F51C49T9A34D	essay1	I sort of disagree with this. As technology becomes more able to solve problems humans have more time and resources to think for themselves. Technology can do more of the mundane tasks and duties which will free up more challenging duties and tasks for humans. Plus as technology increases, it becomes a more challenge for individuals to compete with such as games. TO beat your technology competition, you must be able to think for yourself.
A3F51C49T9A34D	essay2	yes one must study its major cities to get a more understanding. Most major cites are more diverse than the smaller ones. They attract different races, sex and cultures. people who visits or establish themselves in a new country will also be attracted to the major cites. Plus a more diverse businesses will be seen in major cities. Therefor major cities provide a better understanding of the most  important characteristics of a society
A3F51C49T9A34D	essay3	yes, scandals do bring more focus and attention to problems. One example is the Enron scandal a few years ago. With the outright fraud and deceit on their part the company basically disappeared and people lost money and jobs, Because of this we have more regulation in accounting and auditing reporting stop accounting manipulations. So the scandal brought to the forefront on tighter regulation to help the public in making better decisions.
A3FAURB3U6YND5	essay1	"I strongly disagree. I think, if anything, we're given so many more options now about the ways in which we're allowed to think for ourselves. This is kind of a terrible example, and one that I vehemently oppose, but let's take the really awful Trump supporters; the ones that have become white supremacists, Nazis, ""nationalists"" seemingly over night. Before the 2016 election, there were still those movements, but they were on the fringes. They were not looked favorably upon and often ignored. People got so much information about things they may not have thought about before, or were shown different ways of thinking about things, and they're suddenly much different than they were."
A3FAURB3U6YND5	essay2	"I don't think this is necessarily true. I am a ""coastal elite"", I favor bigger cities like LA, NYC, and Boston. But I think only studying major metropolitan areas would be a mistake. There is a lot to America; the south, the midwest, etc., and they matter just as much as the rest of us do. Plus, ignoring them is how we got Trump."
A3FAURB3U6YND5	essay3	I disagree with this position. As time goes on and scandals get worse and worse, we get desensitized to things we shouldn't be, and the morality of society is degraded. Then you get people in powerful positions who are shameless and they're cheered on. We've rewarded bad behavior and that's one of the problems with America right now.
A3FCZNB9E8K3CX	essay1	I think that as people move more towards relying on machines and technology, it will open up the ability for people to pursue activities that use higher thought. People will return to philisophical pursuits, and discuss more and more about human rights and equality. If we as a society aren't as restrained as we currently are physically, and aren't as exhausted mentally, we can think about things that people spent a great deal of time on before the industrial revolution. I also think that it will afford familiies more time to spend with each other, and have more opportunity to bond and become closer. Without constantly worrying about going to work at a certain time, and doing a certain task every day, it will also reduce the issues that come with depression and anxiety. And with less anxiety and depression, people can be more social and be more outgoing. I think that as a whole it will improve society and give people the ability to think more and rely on their own intuition more.
A3FCZNB9E8K3CX	essay2	I think that studying the major cities of a society will give little insight into the society as a whole. The major cities can vary between themselves and aren't representative of the outlying cities and towns that are surely affected by the major cities themselves. You might find that there is a giant city that is bustling and full of life, and crime is high and rampant, while an outlying country town is quiet and slow, and the people living there work hard and go to bed late. It's just not the same, and it's not really possible to gain enough insight into how a society functions just by looking at one piece of the puzzle. You have to look at the puzzle as a whole to understand it entirely, and there are small but important pieces that don't fit in with the larger and more vibrant pieces.
A3FCZNB9E8K3CX	essay3	I think that scandals can shed a great amount of light on things that were swept under the rug. Specifically, the scandal with sexual abuse in Hollywood. It's bringing a lot of horrible actions to the forefront and attempting to hold those people accountable for their actions. I think it's good that people are getting exposed for their behavior, especially when it is violent or unwanted sexual behavior towards another person. It is unfortunate and disgusting that people think that they can get away with these things, and worse - they are geting away with them. Scandals allow the general public to be aware of the things going on behind the scenes, and alow the public to support the victims. It also gives the victims an opportunity to have their voice be heard.
A3FFVN6DPKFDVG	essay1	As people rely more and more on technology to solve their problems, the ability to think for themselves will deteriorate. Problem solving skills are sharpened with use. Depending on technology to solve problems will weaken peoples own personal skills. The key to strengthening your own abilities is repetition. Working out your own solutions to matters builds confidence and self assurance.
A3FFVN6DPKFDVG	essay2	To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities. Take into account the diversity, and variety of communities. Each city is a building block that makes up our society. Each person, family, community is what builds up our world. When you study the people, you find what is important.
A3FFVN6DPKFDVG	essay3	Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker could. They bring to light matters that otherwise would be unknown. More people can pay attention because the news becomes so widespread. Where a reformer may attempt to speak out to make it known, the scandal calls attention to itself. Being scandalous is interesting.
A3FJSCZLT0F0WY	essay1	I agree with the statement that being more reliant on technology does cause humans to think less for themselves.  The first example I think of is using a GPS while driving.  People now can plug in an address and get turn-by-turn directions to get to their destination.  They no longer need to think about where they are going or how to get there.  I have had this happen where I get to my destination and don't vividly recall how I got there, nor would I be able to make the same trip again without the assistance of the GPS.  On the other hand, with technology solving problems and freeing people from thinking about some of those menial tasks; people may have their minds freed up to focus thinking about other things.
A3FJSCZLT0F0WY	essay2	I disagree with the premise that to understand the most important characteristics of a society that you must study its major cities.  The United States has several major cities across the country including New York, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.  If you were to study these major cities, you would come across the realization that they are very different from one another in many aspects.  Their environments and infrastructure, the interpersonal interactions, and their cultures all vary widely from each other.
A3FJSCZLT0F0WY	essay3	Scandals can be useful in focusing attention in ways that individuals cannot conventionally do so.  People get caught up in following scandals, and in a way they become entertainment news.  Once the scandals become a source of entertainment, they are more likely to become water cooler talk and even more people begin to take notice of the events.  If there is a root problem at the center of the scandal, for example the #metoo movement, the scandal brings more attention to that problem with people wanting to follow what is happening with the scandal.
A3FKC2UR61C4T7	essay1	I most definitely agree that the more people rely on technology to solve problems, the more likely the ability of humans to think for themselves will deteriorate. People are already relying very heavily on technology to do not just complicated jobs, but even the simplest of tasks. In the past, we had to work out math problems by hand and actually think about it, now we can just pull out our phones and use the calculator app. People also rely on technology to perform their jobs at work. We have programs and apps that make tasks faster and easier than ever before. Small things like this will slowly but surely lead to humans just relying more and more on technology, thus thinking less for themselves.
A3FKC2UR61C4T7	essay2	I agree to an extent that to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities. If you look at the demographics of major cities in the US, you will see that there are different attributes and characteristics based on where that person is located. Different areas have different traditions and different ways of living. Looking at major cities gives a good idea on what characteristics a society has, but doesn't cover everything as there are areas that are poorer that aren't a major city, and they aren't being accounted for. However, I do believe you can get the general idea of a society by studying its major cities.
A3FKC2UR61C4T7	essay3	I agree to a medium extent that scandals are useful in focusing our attention on problems that a speaker or reformed could not. When scandals are brought to light, the truth is forced to come out. Many speakers and reformers will talk, but people don't pay attention because sometimes, they can sound repetitive and politically correct. However, when a scandal has broken out, people get to see the raw truth, and they also get to see how prestigious people truly handle situations. A scandal is very rarely politically correct, and this makes us focus our attention greatly on these issues.
A3G6L97AX9KR7F	essay1	 The human brain is like a muscle. The more you use it, the more capable it becomes. But as technology progresses it will will allow humans to solve many problems without using their brains. Because people don't have to know how to solve problems themselves, they will become dependent on technology to do so. That means that when that technology is unavailable, people will suddenly find themselves without the capability to solve problems on their own. On top of this, because technology enables information to be shared so effectively, people will easily find the most common answers to problems. And because they don't need to think for themselves, they may fail to think up a better solution than what their technology has provided them.
A3G6L97AX9KR7F	essay2	 The purpose of a society is to allow many people to live together. The most effective way to study how people live together is to look at places where many people are concentrated and have to interact. There is no better place for that than a major city. Major cities can have hundreds of thousands of people, all interacting with one another in both direct and indirect ways. Only there, where a diversity of cultures and opinions meet, can one truly see the major problems of a society. In rural areas, people are more familiar with each other and less likely to encounter strangers they meet every day. They are less likely to encounter new and contrary ideas or cultures. That makes rural areas are poor focus for the study of society, even if they are a crucial element of such a study.
A3G6L97AX9KR7F	essay3	 People are more interested in trouble than peace. Things going wrong is what catches peoples attention. Even if people know that there is a problem with some authority or other, they are loathe to do much about it. That is, unless there is a scandal. When there is a scandal, people will suddenly feel that it is okay to voice the criticisms and complaint that had previously kept quiet People will begin discussing things that they would ordinarily find inappropriate or uninteresting topics of discussion. Scandals not only foster conversation about new topics but they give people a chance to call for change. Even if a person would normally feel that a cause is helpless, if there is a scandal and they see that a lot of people are upset they may feel emboldened to call for change.
A3GDUZQGHRXUJI	essay1	I absolutely agree that human's cognitive thinking will deteriorate as more technology is introduced and relied upon. Human's will not have to actually think for themselves at all. People will just need to know how to use the technology and the rest will be done for them. Skills like math, spelling, grammar, etc. will be lost as humans will not need to actually learn the skills but just how to use a calculator or computer.
A3GDUZQGHRXUJI	essay2	I do not agree with this statement. Cities are only a small part of the characteristics of society and if one only studies major cities, they will be missing out on other very important aspects. Items such as rural living, agriculture, and small town culture will be completely overlooked, which will decrease the knowledge greatly that the person will be gaining otherwise. Cities are a decent part of our culture, but it is most definitely not the most important part! We should study everything as a whole instead of picking out only one or two things. That way our knowledge of the society is broad and not limited.
A3GDUZQGHRXUJI	essay3	I would agree with this statement. Scandals often bring society's attention to thing that we normally wouldn't even think about. There are many times that a company or business is caught in a scandal that people had no idea was even happening. Then we are able to examine the company or business on a whole new level and with more depth than before. Often the truth fully comes out in scandals and brings our attention to even bigger issues that are prevalent. Businesses could be squandering money, or have sweat shops that consumers of the product is unaware of. After the scandal is released, this brings to light all of the wrongful things the business has been doing. It is very helpful to those looking into those companies or people.
A3H32595TVJ34Q	essay1	"Technology is growing fast, every day we're growing more and more reliant to these types of technologies because it's just easier. We use our phones every day, we use our cars every day; so what better way to allow those devices to be able to do things for us and allow us more personal time for ourselves? Take for instance, self-driving cars, they allow us to not have to do anything but press a few buttons and then we can relax, being able to let the car do the driving and us to rely on it while we could be fiddling even more with our phones.  This will result in us losing the ability to think for ourselves over time just because we won't have a reason to. Why should we have to do more work than we need to, if something else can do it for us? Humans can be lazy, especially if we're given the opportunity to be. It's just in our nature, we can be very hard working, but we HAVE to be made to do that. We have to be given the opportunity to be extremely hard working, because as time goes on, we're going to slowly have all kinds of things do stuff for us. An example of this is robots. Robots will eventually be doing work for us in our factories, in our stores, etc and then there will be no reason for humans to ""think"" anymore. So, it will surely start to deteriorate."
A3H32595TVJ34Q	essay2	I believe that people should have to experience something in order to understand where it's coming from. People tend to like to have opinions without much knowledge about it, or experience, because of something they heard, or something they might have just read. To be able to understand characteristics of a society, you would need to experience it first hand because it would allow you to get a better understanding of where that society may be coming from. What they have to deal with on a daily basis and why they live the way they do.   For example, we do not know how bad it is over in other countries, because we have it pretty made over here in the United States. We're a free country, and we have all kinds of tools at our disposal to be able to earn education, jobs, and to be able to do the things we want to freely. While other countries are suffering from diseases, because they have barely any food, or water, they barely have any jobs available and they can't even afford to put clothes on their backs. We take things for granted, and to be able to understand these things, we'd have to see it first hand before we could really know what that's like to be a part of a society that is in poverty, or another state of which we
A3H32595TVJ34Q	essay3	I don't believe scandals are useful because I feel they're more harm than good. This is because this can cause people not to trust you anymore and if you've been called out this can cause people to know your name in a bad light. Scandals can damage your reputation and cause things like job loss, or having difficulty getting a job. I don't see how it can focus our on attention on problems other than focus on the bad and what that person did and it will linger in the news for quite some time. I only see this as something that would be no good for the persons involved. Sure, it could shine light on problems for what not to do, but I feel that this is just common sense and people should know right from wrong.
A3HCGNV93TJO7R	essay1	Technology is a great thing in our time, but with so many great things, there comes consequences. Technology has allowed us access to an unlimited amount of information, an ability to interact and communicate with our family and friends, and the ability to add convenience to our lives. It also has taken away from  our ability to think and find answers for ourselves. I have found, even in my lifetime, that I used to be a great speller and people would often ask me how to spell words. Now, with spell checker, I have found my ability to spell deteriorating. I rely on spell checker, as many do, and don't have take from my memory how to spell. When I need to find an answer to a question, I just ask my phone for the answers. Often times I know the answer, but need the reassurance of Google to know I have the correct answer.
A3HCGNV93TJO7R	essay2	Major cities are where a large amount of people are together in one area, usually a tight area. When we look at the cities, which are often made up of a vast array of backgrounds and cultures, we can see how people interact with one another. In today's society, we have a divide of opinions and political parties. If we look at major cities, we can see this issue and the consequences of certain opinions and policies. Major cities seem to be the ones that have the greatest influence and the people speak the loudest.
A3HCGNV93TJO7R	essay3	"Scandals have become an all too common occurrence in our society. The problem is that most of these ""scandals"" are made up or greatly exaggerated to benefit a particular person, group, or party. There have been a large amount of scandals come up recently about sexual abuse charges. While some of these are legit, many are not, and these accusations can ruin a person's life. People seem to like to like attention and if a scandal is brought up, there are usually many others following right behind to accuse someone just so they can be in the spotlight. Also, there have been scandals brought up about people that are not really scandals at all. I have seen instances where something was considered a scandal just because the other side did not believe in their values. In conclusion, I do not believe that scandals are an effective way to solve problems in our society."
A3HLVFUDKJFKC	essay1	I disagree. The texchnology from the intertnmet provides examples of how to do things as in Yoututbe videos on how to fix things say aproblem with a car. Now this cannot hidnder thinking and can even help people find new ways to do it in a diffrenmt way. Places like home repair sites offer suggestions but a person still has to think and decide what would work out best ofr his needs and what approach to take. As he does things , he will learn to do things his own way evenbtually and this will make him think more not less.Thast is my opinion and works that way for nme
A3HLVFUDKJFKC	essay2	That is a mixed bag . Innner and major cities aoof er a microcosm of what is good and bad in the US. Thae concentration of people often creates strife and violence. It is not totally representative of the snmaller towms and cities in that regard.It does sahow how the sulpport systems work for all people in need so it is a decenty barometer of that aspect though. In general I would say based o my being in the US for 68 years , the vast majority of smaller cities reflect more of a sense of charactersiitvs because the size is not usually given to violence like say in New York City and Chicago wheere people are packed in like sardines and that can bring out the worst in epole.
A3HLVFUDKJFKC	essay3	"It really depends on the persom or gropup who beings up the so called scandal. Often today, scandals are brought about for the purpose of politcs or a cause say wonmen rights. In the case of womens rights is is a good thing that has beeb swept under the rug for too long. As for the politcs side,. it is usually someone with a secret agenda truing to make his ""side"" aoppear better, It s a dirty businmess of cut throat activity and aoften has no bearing on relaity and often proves to be more devisive and hurtful than positive. So I guesss the answer would be it depends on the issue and who brinmgs iot up"
A3I2SQVNFNOIVE	essay1	I do not think that this idea is entirely true. As an engineer, I can say that the development of technology has aided in solving many of humanities problems and making our world more efficient and safe. I can agree that the ability of many humans to use their critical thinking skills will decline but there will always be the ones who design the technology and will use it to their advantage. In my field, you must always be wary of a computer simulation because it is only as good as the parameters that the human sets for it. Using the wrong model in a certain situation can lead to horrible results, even if the computer simulation says things will be fine.
A3I2SQVNFNOIVE	essay2	People from all walks of life and living situations make up the fabric of a society. This includes people in outer suburbs, farms and rural areas, and major cities. Studying just the major cities does not paint a complete portrait of the important characteristics of society. People in major cities rely on people in rural areas for food and goods. If you want a complete picture of society, you must study a broad range of living situations, incomes, and occupations. Studying major cities is only part of the puzzle.
A3I2SQVNFNOIVE	essay3	I agree that scandals can be quite useful. Often when we are warned of a future dilemma in government, we are unable to listen because we cannot picture this situation unfolding in real life. Scandals force us to confront the dark side of our society and come up with measures to prevent people from abusing the system. Most times people are unwilling to listen until it is too late. For this reason, a scandal can be very useful in shaping the future. History's greatest scandals have also produced some of history's greatest positive changes.
A3ICEP6H7JBI15	essay1	I can see why someone might think that, but I believe the opposite to be true. The less mundane problems you have to concern yourself with the more time you have to think about more complex problems. If you don't have to remember telephone numbers because they are stored in your phone, then you never miss an opportunity to make an important call because you forgot the number, plus you don't have to stress about remembering it, so that frees you up to worry about other, more complex things. If you have a roomba, you don't have to set aside time to sweep and potentially waste time that could be going towards something more productive than getting dog hair off the floor. Technology can and probably will be a crutch for many people, but the people who recognize the real value of eliminating those tasks and having the time to pursue more noble goals, will change the world quickly.
A3ICEP6H7JBI15	essay2	I would have agreed with this sentiment before 2016. But that, in my opinion, blows this argument clear out of the water. Before election day in 2016, you would have thought, especially by looking at big cities and metropolitan areas that liberals were outpacing the small-minded, bigots in our country and everyone felt pretty confident about the outcome of that election. Well, turns out, the rural among us and the people who  don't live in the major cities don't necessarily fall into the same camp as their city-dwelling counterparts. Not to say all rural folk are ignorant and prejudiced while all city people are progressive and sophisticated, but looking at demographics before the election you could easily let yourself fall into that and assume that with the denser population of the major cities elections would be up to those more metropolitan people and you sort of forget about the views of the 'fly-over states'. But boy was that a mistake.
A3ICEP6H7JBI15	essay3	Assuming we're talking about tabloid-style sex, drugs, and video-tapes scandals, they more often than not are useless at the heart of them. I don't care who sleeps with who and what drugs people are doing and what happens behind closed doors (unless its in direct contradiction to policy you are pushing through that negatively effects others, then its downright heinous). But, when a scandal comes to light the most useful part the majority of the time is seeing how the accused parties act before, during, and at the end of a scandal. That's when you can really see the truth of someone; when they lie and lie and lie and then irrefutable proof comes out, you have no choice but to look at them differently and see them for what they really are. The facts of the thing are not nearly as important as the actions taken when it comes out into the spotlight. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case recently, but I believe eventually it will tarnish a specific someone.
A3IP6UCY1JIIHV	essay1	As people become more reliant on technology to solve problems, their ability to think for themselves deteriorate.  I've seen many examples of this in real life.  I have observed people who doesn't know the phone number of any of their friends and families, because their phone records this information for them.  I've also observed people who are unable to remember basic common sense information, because they rely on their phones to search google or other similar services for information as needed.  Worst of all, instead of thinking for themselves when faced with a problem, I often see people posting their problems online and simply taking whatever advice that other people throw their way.  Overall technology have produced a generation of people who are a lot more dependent on both other people and machines, and less capable of doing things on their own.  They rely on consensus instead of thinking for themselves.
A3IP6UCY1JIIHV	essay2	Cities are the heart of any society, they are where the bulk of the denizens of any given society congregate.  Therefore, in order to understand the most important characteristics of a given society, the study of its major cities are a must.  In cities people gather, therefore it is easy to observe them interact with each other.  More importantly, in cities people who are unrelated would interact frequently with each other.  In contrast, in rural or suburban areas people don't interact as much, and when they do, it's often with a much smaller circle of people, mostly immediate family members.  Overall, cities provide much more opportunities to observe people from all walks of life in a society interact, and can offer many clues on how a particular society functions.
A3IP6UCY1JIIHV	essay3	Scandals are useful because they bring attention to issues that people ordinarily would not dare bring to attention.  In our present day society, people are often constrained by political correctness and fear of retribution to truly speak their mind.  Scandals forces people to look at issues they ordinarily would politely ignore, and forces society in general to confront said issues.  Scandals attract attention and forces people to look at issues in a way that is not sugar coated, as opposed to how typical reformers may present an issue, in a manner where it's politically correct and careful to preserve their own social status.  Although scandals can be very emotional to deal with, dealing with them overall benefits society and promotes progress and healing.
A3J5KTBHZI60H	essay1	I believe that human thinking will not deteriorate. More and more technology that takes out some conventional thinking we use to do. However there are high level and abstract thinking patterns we have to employ to be able to use these new technologies. Even if you don't read as much now because of all the automatic text to speech reading, you still are activating your hearing and theater of the mind in the brain.
A3J5KTBHZI60H	essay2	I believe that you must study cities to understand the important parts of society. Most of what makes societies interesting from small tribes we use to live in, are the larger gatherings. Societies are defined heavily by how you manage that many people. Laws and sectioned areas and taxes all come from upholding a small area that holds many. If you ignore cities while trying to understand societies you only get a very shallow opinion on how things really work and more importantly why.
A3J5KTBHZI60H	essay3	I believe that scandals are not useful. Most people are able to be interested in news or issues regardless of whether or not there is a scandal. Scandals in recent times have been important for views and making money. Getting popular by exposing a scandal isn't bring attention to the problem in any way that a news article wouldn't. The only benefit is that it has an initial shock value that a news post might not.
A3J85WP15JFYW0	essay1	Technology will only help humans think at a higher level. Instead of wasting time solving little problems, we can use technology to do this for us thus giving humans more opportunities to think at a higher level and solver bigger problems. For example, with the invention of advance computers, we're able to solve thousands of mathematical equations within seconds. This allows us think about bigger aspirations we can achieve.
A3J85WP15JFYW0	essay2	It is most important to study major cities to understand the current characteristics of a society. Metropolitan areas are always going to be the most advance aspects of a society. To understand all of their current culture, technology, and trends, one must start with studying the major cities. It is the place in society where all the great innovators and mind meet to solve problems and create ideas. The cities are where you would need to go to get and understanding of the current and future state of that society.
A3J85WP15JFYW0	essay3	"Scandals are very useful in getting the attention of the general public. We live in a ""clickbait"" society today, and people only pay attention to the most interesting things. A lot of time policies and problems are not interesting to the general public. However, if it's attached to a scandal, it becomes a very riveting story for everyone. Take for example the recent scandal with Trump and Stormy Daniels. The underlining illegal campaign finances would not get as much attention as it is right now if it isn't attached to a scandal with a porn star."
A3J8Y94SGZ3R0E	essay1	I strongly believe that technology is definitely causing that humans do not take advantage of their full potential. In my opinion technology makes people lazy and we are relying on it for all the simple tasks that we normally did before such as waking up in the morning, performing simple math tasks, learning phone numbers, etc. Technology is an amazing tool but we must understand that there is a limit when using it.
A3J8Y94SGZ3R0E	essay2	I personally beleive that major cities play a very important role in society. If major cities have a certain issue then it will eventually become a problem for small cities. The issues that arise in big cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, etc will spread like a cancer to other places and the issue (drugs, terrorist attacks, homincides, violence, robberies, etc) will be uncontrollable everywhere.
A3J8Y94SGZ3R0E	essay3	"I  would say that scandals can be uselful only if they are positively changing something. Otherwise, scandals can be just a ""curtain of smoke"" for more important issues. Scandals have a purpose and we as spectators must know that there is always a counterpart and we should remain objective when an scandal arises. We all have heard about scandals in political figures, celebrities, athletes but we must learn from it."

A3KYEREPRMOTS4	essay1	I do not think that this statement is true. I think that while technology aids humans in solving problems it does not deteriorate the amount of thinking that we need to do. It does give us access to solve much more difficult problems than we could in the past. Instead of simply making up a reason for the problem, we are able to actually get the information that we need in order to solve the issue.
A3KYEREPRMOTS4	essay2	I do not think that studying major cities will give you the most important characteristics of a society. There is a large difference between the society that exists inside of a major city, and what exists outside of it. In order to actually understand the most important characteristics you would need to understand both. It is more important to get a well rounded picture of everything, instead of a one sided picture from just the cities.  I think if you took it all into account that you would be able to understand society better.
A3KYEREPRMOTS4	essay3	Scandals are the opposite of useful when it comes to focusing on problems. Unfortunately when you introduce a scandal, the scandal itself becomes what is focused on instead of the problems that may need to be faced. People are always interested in a train wreck or anything of that matter. The bigger the scandal the more difficult it is to get people to focus on the actual issue. I believe that focusing on the issue will bring more positive attention to it.
A3L5XFNSOY6QET	essay1	It is clear that humans lose the ability to think independently the more we become reliant on technology. Two clear examples of this are autocorrect and auto-predict when typing on smartphones. Autocorrect automatically fixes spelling. It means people do not need to think about how to spell words anymore because the technology does this for us. As a result we no longer think about how to spell words. Auto-predict automatically guesses the words or sentences you want to type. People no longer need to think about how to construct sentences or messages to each other.  A third example of technology that diminishes people's ability to think for themselves is GPS. GPS tells us how to get from place to place. Whereas we used to think logically about how to go places, we now rely on machines to tell us. People are less aware of geography because they have no need to think about it it. Obviously we are not quite there yet, but these technologies are taking away our need and thus our ability to think for ourselves.
A3L5XFNSOY6QET	essay2	There are other important aspects of a society than just a city. While a lot of people live in cities and this does show some characteristics of a society, there are stark differences between people who live there and people who live in more rural areas. People in rural areas differ in that they are usually more conservative than people in cities. They are usually less business oriented and might be more likely to be farmers. Their interests and values differ from the hustle and bustle , more liberal cities. just one step in rural montanna and you might think you are in a different country than if you were in the middle of times square. As such, you must examine all types of areas and not just the cities. No area is more important than any other.
A3L5XFNSOY6QET	essay3	Scandals are distractions and can be used as such. Many times scandals do not relate to specific issues and infact distract from them. Although it does focus our attention, it is often focusing our attention on issues that do not matter. Someone who knows this might be able to use this to manipulate people by orechestrating a scandal to distract the public while doing something unpopular in the background, relatively unnoticed. People must be wary of scandals and the harmful way they are distractions to society. We must be aware of when they are important and when they are just distractions to allow more nefarious activities to happen in the background. Another issue is that people can become desensitized to scandals. When there are daily scandals, it becomes a way of life. People become exhausted and can no longer focus on them. While it might seem that scandals can focus our attention, overuse does the exact opposite.
A3LC6M2EMDBBXP	essay1	There will always be things that can't be solved with technology.  People will also just have new things to think about, instead of the things we currently do.  The new technology will require new ways to think.  The attitude that technology will make everyone dumb is what keeps innovation and progress from happening. It's the same through process that kept science and medicine from advancement for decades.
A3LC6M2EMDBBXP	essay2	Major cities don't usually have the character or traditions that smaller communities do.  However, they do have a large assortment of people to learn from.  In small towns, most people are very similar to each other and and can be very different from other small towns.  Cities have people from all types of backgrounds, with different opinions, views, and traditions.  Society is probably better reflected by big cities, but it will also leave out some cultures and characteristics.
A3LC6M2EMDBBXP	essay3	If the scandal is reported on in an unbiased way, I can see how that would be the case.  It's a real life example that people will look to instead of some guy on stage talking.  But the issue is that scandals are often reported incorrectly, or with a biased spin that strengthens viewpoints of some groups based on who the reports are targeting.  Big scandals are also usually more well known, as opposed to a speaking event that only a few people would attend.  Both have their place in the world, and have the ability to broaden someones mind.
A3LECJA9RVQQKZ	essay1	"There is already a mass movement towards reliance on technology to solve problems. This is making people dumber. However, there is and probably always will be a portion of the population that are purists and will want to know HOW to solve a problem, even more than than they might want to know the solution. These people will not only be elite, but they will be the ones who will probably program the technology that spits out the answers for most of the other humans. These will be the ones who are able to reach a solution that is truly workable for organic, biological humans more so than the solutions reached by ""technology""."
A3LECJA9RVQQKZ	essay2	To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its AGRICULTURE. People will die if they do not eat. Cities do not provide enough food to sustain a large, prosperous population. Thus, it is a study of how food is grown and provided to the rest of the masses that will indicate the characteristics of a society. When agriculture fails, so will society, since the members of that society will move away to where there IS food or else die. It is dependence on or independence of natural resources that will determine the success or failure of a society.
A3LECJA9RVQQKZ	essay3	In order for darkness to thrive, it must act in secret. The corruption and decay of a society depends on the secrets kept by the underbelly of that society. Scandals represent an explosion of secret actions being brought to public attention. People are often shocked to realize that such corrupt actions are even possible. It makes everybody consider what they really want in their culture. Scandals bring problems to the surface so people can decide en masse how they want to live.
A3M01W8KKZF99X	essay1	In today's society there is technology and distraction everywhere. Because of this i totally agree that the ability of humans to think for themselves will deteriorate.We are basically glued to our smartphones. A lot of people spend hours on social media like Facebook. Scrolling through there Newsfeed and hardly have any real human interaction. A lot of people believe everything they see on Facebook and posts get shared thousands of times on there and other social media platforms. This shows me how brainwashed and manipulated you can become through social media. The Media on there can really influence todays society.
A3M01W8KKZF99X	essay2	I think people's characteristics in bigger cities are more likely to be molded through outer influences like Social Media and commercial in general. In bigger cities there are more distractions than in small villages out in the country. People are more on their phones and more connected with smart devices in bigger cities. Where as in small towns in the country people are more social and have more one on one human interaction. You see this for example when you visit a big city like los angeles where everyone walks around with their eyes glued to their phone.A small town out in the country people are more approachable.
A3M01W8KKZF99X	essay3	"Distraction is the only way to get people to not focus on whats really going on. Therefore Scandals are being created. It's easy to spread scandals and miss information through social media where it can get viral and reach millions of people real quick. People stopped thinking for themselves and believe something if a lot of people have liked or shared certain information or in such case a scandal. Nobody does the work and actually researches the matter. In todays world everything has to happen quick, nobody would have time for that. They believe what is being told to them through social media. So News outlets use it to their advantage and spread ""fake news"" or so called scandals to cover up or manipulate."
A3M0C5D28CCZCJ	essay1	"I agree with the statement that more and more people will be unable to think for themselves due to relying on technology to solve our problems. It might take a generation or two - for current generations it's just a fact of life to have technology in their daily lives.But I know that my generation (Baby Boomers) still think back on the ""good old days"" when we had to get up to (truly!) turn the channel on the television, and we'll still do things the way we grew up to do it or the way we saw the generation before us do it."
A3M0C5D28CCZCJ	essay2	"Society is just a term that really means 'A Who's Who of Relevance"", and in today's world, that makeup is found in our major cities. That's where elections are won and lost, where our major news and entertainment comes from, and where we travel to to eat the finest food and view the best in theatre and the arts. The mix of people, cultures, ethnicities, and socio-economic backgrounds, that is found in major cities tells us what is happening in society as a whole and what we can expect from past trends."
A3M0C5D28CCZCJ	essay3	Scandals are useful, but not because of how it focuses our attention in ways that no speaker or reformer could. Because, quite often, it is THE speaker and reformer that is the one caught up in the scandal!  What was thought of as a scandal is quite often just behavior that our neighbor next door is discovered to also do.  It helps  us see that no one is above making mistakes or having faults or just being human. And although it quite often is morally wrong, it helps us see that no one is really better than the rest of us, and we can believe that superiority is imagined and not real.
A3MXZMAX4XEZU4	essay1	I believe that technology is a fundamental part of human development. But sometimes it reaches a critical point because people use it incorrectly. I agree that some physical abilities can be lost but they increase the mental abilities of the people.  Technology facilitates jobs that were impossible to do a few years ago. It is more positive than negative.
A3MXZMAX4XEZU4	essay2	when studying the main cities we realize that social models were used for their triumph or loss at a social level.  I think it is correct because of some cities that have failed we can learn from their mistakes and focus on their virtues.
A3MXZMAX4XEZU4	essay3	some scandals helps US to pay attention in some situations that not normally would we do corrections. of course some scandals are not certain. we have to check the source. an example is a scandal paedophiles if never had come out in the light authorities not would take care.
A3NUIEPMZSHEZ4	essay1	I'm not sure that I entirely agree with the position that technology use will diminish human reasoning abilities.  I can see in day to day life that some people are too preoccupied with technology.  Particularly, people are misusing the internet for trivial matters.  But then people always prefer the trivial to the complex.  That is in aggregate.  I think people are no smarter or dumber than they've ever been, in aggregate.  I believe that as technology allows us to speedily access information, less of our brain power is consumed in memorization and rote learning.  Technology should allow us to open our minds to new possibilities.  To expand our horizons.  Think of all the cool stuff man envisioned 100 years ago that is now reality.
A3NUIEPMZSHEZ4	essay2	Major cities are not a new phenomenon.  Some reports suggest that the Incans had huge cities.  Rome was a huge city.  Humans tend to coagulate together.  Whether that's the need for comfort or commerce or what have you.  Major cities are a normal human occurrence.  It is part and parcel of human experience to band together in large numbers.  Therefore to truly understand human nature, there is no better laboratory than big cities.  All facets of human behavior can be observed.  Complex human interactions happen every minute.  From so many lives, from so many stories, all tumultuous, comes a unique creation, the big city with it's seeming orderliness and cohesion.
A3NUIEPMZSHEZ4	essay3	People love scandals.  Why?  Are we just lascivious by nature?  Is it the novelty?  The diversion?  For whatever reason, we all tend to focus our attention on scandals.  On the one hand, this points to our baser natures, but on the other it does serve a purpose in society.  Scandals can help improve society.  They do so by highlighting disparities, unfairness, the plight of the powerless, the margins of society.  Who can enjoy a lavish meal knowing that a child is hungry down the street?  Call it guilt or social conscience or whatever, but many problems are addressed through public shaming.
A3O5EU9QQV2OS1	essay1	I agree with this statement because, the brain is a tissue which has memory circuits and if they are not used to their full potential they will surely start to deteriorate. As technology advances more and more it will make sure that it starts thinking for itself in order to make the best decision possible in the situation. When that happens the role of humans will be very limited and the function of the brain will start to deteriorate.
A3O5EU9QQV2OS1	essay2	This is true, because a society's major achievements can be seen in their major cities. From the architecture and buildings to all of it's technological advancements. If a country's major cities are structured and well build then it means that the country is prosperous and it has a lot to offer.
A3O5EU9QQV2OS1	essay3	Scandals are something which every person tries to avoid because they are most likely hiding something that they don't want people to know. If a scandal breaks out it points us to some problem that people have and they want solved. If a scandal never happens the spotlight will never be on that problem and it will never get resolved.
A3O5JKO0ADLXDB	essay1	the task of thinking deteriorated due to the ease in which the technology advances, for example: computers is an easy way to perform a task that can even autocomplete texts, add, subtract, divide in these moments there are many programs that facilitate the work of thinking.
A3O5JKO0ADLXDB	essay2	I do not think it is necessary to study the cities in order to know the characteristics of a society, that it is better to study the culture and tradition of the people in this society.
A3O5JKO0ADLXDB	essay3	I think that it is not necessary that a scandal happens to focus or pay attention to our problems. I think it serves to serve as an example.  the scandals serve as an example to avoid making mistakes.
A3P0P0DRSOX52W	essay1	"We are already seeing the affect of technology on humans' ability to think for themselves. It is common practice, especially among students, to go to internet search engines when faced with question that needs an answer. People have begun to trust that the internet has the answers they need, and therefore they don't need to think through issues for themselves. As artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent, I think this trend will continue, and I think this is unfortunate. Group-think can be a very powerful form of peer pressure, and fewer people will be willing to come up with ideas that do not conform to the ""wisdom"" of the group. People need to think independently, and have the courage not to conform when they are faced with a consensus which may not be valid."
A3P0P0DRSOX52W	essay2	Most people in the industrialized world live in urban areas. Cities are where the seats of government, education and commerce are found and where power and wealth is is most highly concentrated. New technologies and trends invariably begin in cities, and so they can set the tone for the larger society. However, we must never lose sight of the fact that the world is largely fed and powered in the rural areas. Agriculture, mining, energy production and other processes involving natural resources are mostly rural activities, and those are vital parts of society. We must also study those areas in order to fully understand how civilization functions.
A3P0P0DRSOX52W	essay3	The news media thrives on scandals, and a sense of outrage is what focuses many people to consume media. Scandals provide an opportunity for politicians and other society influencers to create a narrative to shape public opinion. The problem with scandals is that they are often not representative of much of society. Thus, leaders can create a sense of emergency that does not really exist in most people's lives. Society as a whole is built on family relationships, work relationships, community interactions and other social activity that is often positive and truly representative of society. A scandal is often an aberration which should not be taken to be the norm.
A3PQ0KHESAZZ0Y	essay1	I agree that with people relying on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate. It is true. We see it in our schools with the young people. No longer do they need to know how an answer to a math question comes about, just that you get the answer with a calculator, and as fast as you possibly can. Technology is wonderful, but in small doses because becoming dependent upon it makes our minds lazy and us less cognitively conscious. I think it is particularly important for older people to keep their mind active and able to think critically and carefully to remain a live and productive. If our minds get lazy, then our bodies get lazy too and we will all end up worse off in the long run.
A3PQ0KHESAZZ0Y	essay2	I agree. With a bigger population, it is easier to get a larger variety to personality and lifestyle types to study. Large cities are full of very interesting people, large populations with different mixtures of cultures, personality, ways of living, career choices, and activity choices. Whereas, in rural areas, with lower populations, it seems that there is less variety and diversity and sort of the same types of people and socio-economical groupings than the big cities. All you have to do is experience them both and it is easy to see how different the experiences, and the people are in big cities as opposed to rural areas. I think it is very important to study big cities to really get a more accurate picture of all groups in society.
A3PQ0KHESAZZ0Y	essay3	I agree. Sometimes it takes a scandal to get the rest of society to notice the problems that exist. Take the me too situation right now. Eventually, wrong doings will come out into the open, even with the most careful attempts at cover ups. Scandals usually happen when pressure builds up like a volcano and finally it needs to explode in order for things to start healing and spark change to make things right again. Let's face it. Most people like a good scandal and scandals really bring attention to some horrible situations that need to be made right in this world. It certainly makes us stand up and take notice. If it is not eventful, most people would just look past it and not care. So, scandals are necessary, unfortunately.
A3QEVFM3UD67BA	essay1	"I agree with the statement that the ability of humans to think for themselves will deteriorate. It has been happening in my lifetime that more and more, people depend on an electronic device to get answers. One example is when people talk about for information or facts. Mostly when looking at facts, a person might automatically grab their phone and ""Google"" a response.  It is so prevalent that now even when it comes to a matter of opinion people will usually look at social media and other online sources to form an opinion, often looking to see what the popular"
A3QEVFM3UD67BA	essay2	I do not agree that we must study major cities to understand important characteristics of society. The reason is because society as a whole started small. The fact that the first humans decided to live together in tiny villages thousands of years ago should show us that human nature is the same, whether in a large city or a small town. We as people have different values and different ways of conducting groups and different interests which enrich all cultures. I believe that
A3QEVFM3UD67BA	essay3	I disagree with the statement that scandals are useful, to me a scandal is just showing a flaw in someone's character and a scandal is the most public way that someone can make a mistake. Also, scandals have way of bringing judgmental opinons to the surface and that is not useful at all, I have never seen or heard about a scandal in which the transgression was used as a teaching moment. More often than not, the scandal is only used to sell papers, books or any othe
A3QL8ZAD9BKWUF	essay1	"This is definitely a problem we will face in the future and a problem some of us face currently. The first topic that comes to mind is google. Before we had search engines finding answers proved extremely more difficult as you would have to look through books, or find someone knowledgeable in the field you are looking for. Nowadays you can just put the question in google and have the solution in seconds and this can falter creativity and problem solving. Another option that comes to mind is social media. More and more people talk via emails and messages making communicating much easier and faster but hindering social ideas and functions. More people are becoming ""socially awkward"" due to this fact. Eventually we will barely have to think as the technology of the future will progressively become better and faster, It is a double edged swords in some sort as we will get the information we need and want but we will lose our creativity and problem solving skills slowly. This is only a few examples"
A3QL8ZAD9BKWUF	essay2	I agree a little and then i also disagree a little. For example going to new york city you will experience a lot of culture of new york there as that is where most people are and where most things happen. However you are missing the fact that smaller cities have equal information about the society. Just looking at one huge example won't let you know the culture of the full location. Same goes as if i go to the united kingdom and i only visit London. I'll understand a lot of the culture from london however i will be missing the culture of the smaller cities that make up the united kingdom. If you want to see the majority of information and some important information then going to the major city is fine. However going to the smaller cities will also provide extremely important characteristics about that location.
A3QL8ZAD9BKWUF	essay3	Scandals are definitely useful as i think they open our eyes to possibilities. Let's say there is a scandal floating around the internet that google is listening to our microphones to target ads to you. This is a horrible thing to do as this is a invasion of privacy obviously. But because that scandal is out there it has gotten more people focused on that potential problem. There is power in numbers and if more people look into that information you can find real problems and deal with them. For example people will be upset if there is a rape scandal about a certain performer. This scandal is spreading rapidly and now most people know about it. Because it has spread it has made some people relive memories and reminded them of that situation and they were too afraid to speak up about it. Now that others have spoken up the scandal has effectively lead to justice.
A3QSJY1FFN0N6V	essay1	Human beings learn through action.  The more you do something, generally the better you get at it.  This is how we all learned to memorize our times tables in elementary school.  We memorized them through repetition.  Currently, people are using their minds less and less to solve problems.  Instead, they are relying on technology for assistance.  This weakens the connections that the human mind has made.  The less we use the connections, the weaker they become.  People will eventually lose the ability to use their critical thinking skills and will be heavily reliant on technology, which is dangerous because it is not a stable system and could potentially disappear under certain circumstances.  If that were to happen human beings would be left helpless and without the necessary skills to make critical decisions and solve problems.  While it is true that technology has made our lives easier, it is important to realize that we still must teach future generations how to solve problems without it.
A3QSJY1FFN0N6V	essay2	Major cities have always been the hub of society.  This is where the most diversity among people exists.  Because there are so many people living in one place it is bound to be filled with different types of people with different world views.  Although the populations of major cities are diverse, one can look at a city and find a somewhat common way of thinking.  For instance, San Francisco is considered to be somewhat of a liberal, open-minded place and New York tends to be both artsy as well as sophisticated.  This is a smaller snapshot of society as a whole and looking at a city in this way or a collection of different cities in a society can give a pretty accurate overall impression of what a society as a whole is like.
A3QSJY1FFN0N6V	essay3	I do not think scandals are useful because rather than focus our attention on an important problem, they generally focus out attention away from the most important issues.  Scandals tend to be based on superficial, unimportant matters such as Bill Clinton's affair while he was in office.  That took attention away from much more pressing issues that country was facing.  This happens constantly throughout history.  American people have their attention diverted from the important issues because they are more concerned with whether or not someone cheated on their wife or made a sexist comment.  Meanwhile, people are starving or committing crimes against humanity, but this doesn't seem to bother anyone or capture the interest of everyday Americans.
A3RCX3IQ8L6HHW	essay1	While it's true that on the surface it would appear that people will lose the ability to problem-solve by relying more on technology, the reality is that is not true. History has shown that humans have constantly adapted and thrived from new technology. Critical thought has not decreased throughout time, and new innovations will not change that. For example take a baker. At first they beat eggs by hand. But when given powered tools to do this, they not only adapted to that new tool, but found new recipes to make that they could now do. Humans will always adapt, but they never remain stagnant with those adaptions.
A3RCX3IQ8L6HHW	essay2	The major cities of the world showcase the characteristics of a society. In them you have the greatest collection of like-minded people in a society. While the individual cannot be ignored, the overarching belief, morals, and expectations will shine through as a collective whole. Does this society value education? How does it treat its downtrodden? Does it accept new technologies? Look to a major city to find those answers. They will have the resources to display the main characteristics of a society.
A3RCX3IQ8L6HHW	essay3	Scandals are a double edged sword. On the one hand they are very useful in exposing the ugly underside of a culture. They shake people out of complacency due to sensationalizing an issue so that it can't be ignored. It's something so big that huge portions of the population know about it and it gets them talking. In that way scandals can ultimately help society, as long as positive action results from it. On the other hand, what gets regarded as a scandal often isn't. Trivial matters are sometimes sensationalized to the point of distraction. Why focus on important issues when there's juicy gossip to talk about? It all depends on the scandal.
A3ROADR7T6811	essay1	i will agree to it somewhat but not completely . the technology has made our life easy and we have in our hand these powerful mobile that can handle enormous data and connected us to the whole world . there is also disadvantages of these tech. we relay on these tech way to much and has stop using our brain for small thing even if we have to do simple calculation we
A3ROADR7T6811	essay2	if u want to understand something u have to look at that thing where it is in more quantity and free to thrive as they please without any limitation . that is the same case there . if u want to look at the characteristics of the society , u have to look at the metropolitan cities cuz there u will find the complex system of how the society work . i think u cant find it  in sub urban or rural cities . in the largest jungle u can find the biggest lion
A3ROADR7T6811	essay3	yeah i think it is true . before the scandal people only think that the system is working fine so there is nothing to be corcerned about .even if someone informed them of the ugly thing they just ignored it and move on but scandals get their attentions , not at first tho but after some time they start to realize that things are not as they look and start to think about it and form opinion about it and then discuss with each other and become educated about it . so in a sense they liberate themselves
A3SGR153YCJ1XN	essay1	There is some validity to this fear.  Before the majority of the population had a smartphone on them at all times, the average person needed to be able to do quick arithmetic in their heads. When reading information, people had to try much harder to retain that information if they wanted to tell somebody else - now, they can recheck the Wikipedia article on their phone if they forget. There is not much reason to cultivate memory or math skills in everyday life. A person's capacity to learn and think does deteriorate if they are not used to exercising their brain.
A3SGR153YCJ1XN	essay2	I do not think that this is true. Yes, the majority of a society's population is concentrated in major cities. But there is a different culture present in city life vs rural life, and just because there are more people part of the city culture does not mean that we should disregard rural culture. People that live in major cities may have been born in more rural areas, and vice versa. There are good and bad aspects of city culture, and good and bad parts of rural culture. It's close minded and unfair to say that characteristics shared primarily by people who live in cities are the most important.
A3SGR153YCJ1XN	essay3	Scandals invite a mob mentality that is not helpful for unbiased, intellectual discourse. Yes, you may enjoy a scandal and think that it cuts right to the heart of an issue if it happens to lead to an outcome that you personally want. But it's just as likely that a scandal will ignore all logic and reason and start a witch hunt for someone who doesn't deserve it. For instance, the Monica Lewinsky incident with Bill Gates that got him impeached - extramarital sex has nothing to do with a man's ability to run a country. This scandal focused people's attentions on something that didn't matter, and had was fueled by blind hatred.
A3T0X1R1A94R1J	essay1	"This statement is proving so true already, with the advent of smartphones and the proliferation and mass-usage of Google. People no longer hold themselves accountable, and by that, I mean they simply refuse to think but instead rely on their technological devices to ""mine"" answers for them. Whether it be something as quick as ""Let me Google that,"" or, the act of pulling out a calculator app to determine a tip, people are simply thinking less and less. In the past, people would rack their brain for answers, use scratch paper for multiplication, or any number of other tasks that are now delegated to either their smartphones or their personal computers.  But it goes beyond this.  People no longer even want to think novel. I observed many players in online chess relying on a computer to get them out of ""sticky"" situations, by suggesting the next move. Similarly, scrabble players in games such as ""Words with Friends"" endlessly throw down scrambles of letters until it accepts a word. No one is really seeking to think anymore, because they know they can be bailed out by this app, that device, or whatever. It is really the tip of the iceberg to mention games, to mention things as simple as calculating tips, because as technology evolves people will find other ways to become lazy -- even if it means inserting the ""answer chip"" into their brain in some cyborg configuration. The future might be bright, but it isn't due to humans thinking more. People are just going to continue to find easier methods to solve their toughest problems, and the true thinking power of the mind will become something we no longer even value. That should scare each and every one of us, really."
A3T0X1R1A94R1J	essay2	"Cities have always played a major role in culture. Dating back to the earliest civilizations, when man began to collectively pool in areas like the Fertile Crescent and Babylon, the learning increased, as did the number of problems the society had. Densely populated areas give rise to specialization, and seeing what a city specializes in tells one a lot about its culture. In Babylon, for instance, astrologers (and astronomers, the two were largely synonymous then) began to devise star charts and map the heavens. This told us that Babylonians placed a key emphasis on the stars, believing that they controlled their destinies.  Modern parallels certainly exist. In areas of California, industry tells us a lot about the collective society we live in. Silicon Valley is an extensive mecca of computer and technological development which shows our society's reliance on A.I. in general. As one travels further, landmarks can be observed. A short drive will take one to places such as San Francisco, where archaic architecture and monuments such as the Golden Gate Bridge show our appreciation for beauty--but the trolley cars contrast it with our desire to hold onto the ""charming things"" of the past. Every area really tells a story, with its industry, with its architecture, and with its specialization. So much of this story can be derived without much conversation at all, and that is pretty astounding, really.  When one begins to interview people, he or she sees what really makes them tick, filling in the gaps in the story further still."
A3T0X1R1A94R1J	essay3	Scandals illustrate the most sordid aspects of an individual, or of a group. While negative by nature, the response and the type of scandal involved dictates our feelings towards the person highly. For instance, when Bill Clinton was accused of having relations with Monica Lewinsky, we learned a lot about our president. While we do not necessarily know if the accusations were true (Yeah, right), we did learn that Clinton had a bit of a flirtatious nature, which made us question his fidelity towards Hillary Clinton. Because we all mostly deduced that Clinton did engage in relations (namely, oral sex) with Lewinsky, we learned that his relationship with his wife was mostly a professional one, perhaps devoid of romantic love altogether.   This told us more about Clinton than any half-hearted interview he could have given expressing admiration for his wife. The truth was in the pudding, so to speak, and while he was acquitted in his hearing for Impeachment, his nervous answering of the questions and outright lying (can we call it anything else?) really showed his true character, for better or worse--and mostly for worse.
A3TUCOUVSP9ZGY	essay1	Technology seems to be taking over. There was once a day when no such technology existed and people actually had to work through and solve problems themselves. Where has that drive gone? I have seen it myself, where some millennial, but more of the younger generation, has no idea how to do the basics in life such as: doing a load of laundry, building a shelf with instructions, more importantly, going outside and having fun! They are wasting away using their smartphones, computers and video game consoles. The worst part in my opinion is that technology is taking over the workforce. For example, self check out machines are taking jobs away from people and there are numerous other technologies d
A3TUCOUVSP9ZGY	essay2	I understand that the major cities cause numerous issues being a factor in climate change. But I think it's ignorant to forget about the land on the outskirts, where deforestation is happening. Yes, major cities have crime, drugs and deviant behavior but that can all big fixed. Before major cities, it was all land, cultivating the land, knowing and learning how to survive off of it. This all changed after the industrial revolution. It made things more convenient to use machines and factories to speed up production. But let's not forget where our ancestors came from, our past, how this world all came about. There are only a few people that live in those ways and it seems life is much less stressful under those circumstances, living off the grid, not having to worry about anyone or anything except you.
A3TUCOUVSP9ZGY	essay3	Scandals are a distractions. It's disgusting to me how society is more worried about the Kardashian's drama rather than actually problems our citizens face each day. The abuse of power is out of this world. We have starving children and families, people living in poverty, racism and many more problems that are just being covered up by these scandals. I mean, why are scandals more important and being made out to be that way? We have REAL problems that are going on and being made out to be not as bad as they actually are. I think the government needs to refocus on issues and not scandals. Don't get me wrong, some scandals are really an issue but not as big as the problems that need to be fixed. It seems like every day there's some type of fake news or scandal that comes out, and for what? It's just drama and annoyance to someone like me.
A3U74S280Z4B0	essay1	"I agree with this assertion because we can readily see just how much we are relying on technology every day. For example, most people seem to be very reliant on GPS to find their way to unfamiliar places. The GPS does all the ""thinking"" for us and we no longer have to consult a traditional map and use our reasoning skills to find out way to a specific location. All the effort that once had to be expended to find a location using a paper map is not longer needed and since there is a belief that the mind is like any other ""muscle"" in the sense that exercise improves it, one might conclude that things like GPS relieve us of thinking and reasoning that may have actually improved our thinking and reasoning abilities. It's clear that relying on technology too a great extent makes we humans think less for ourselves and that may not be a positive thing for our ability to think and solve problems on our own."
A3U74S280Z4B0	essay2	"Cities offer the most diverse and concentrated traits and characteristics of any society. The great diversity of city populations allow for researchers to experience the most complete experience possible by exposing them to many aspects of a society. It is also far more efficient to study society in a city setting simply because it is all so accessible in a relatively small geographic location. Cities are where it all ""happens"" and are the central hubs for cultural institutions like universities, media centers and museums. Cities appear to control what constitutes most popular culture in a society and are the natural locations for studies that can reveal the most about any culture."
A3U74S280Z4B0	essay3	We, as humans have a natural, if somewhat morbid, fascination with scandal of almost any variety. A scandal attracts attention like few other events, particularly in realms such as politics and entertainment. Despite all the effort that has gone into promoting any cause or social issue, nothing seems able to draw attention like a scandal and in that way, they are indeed useful in some ways. For example, the latest focus on sexual harassment began with a scandal and has resulted in a new focus on the issue that has been sustained for months. And it all began with a scandal when a Hollywood figure was accused of sexually harassing a large number of women. This has empowered other victims to come forward and take action against those that have wronged them and that is an excellent example of how a scandal can focus national attention on an important and often overlooked issue.
A3UTFL5JHRQCM1	essay1	I think that this is true. The more we use google and smart phones, the more we are relying less on our cognitive thought process that has helped us evolve throughout history. People are getting shorter attention spans due to this consistent onslaught of data and information. I believe that as we become more reliant on technology, the more we will become less reliant on our bodies and our minds. You could almost say that we are starting to de-evolve.
A3UTFL5JHRQCM1	essay2	Bit cities are they epicenter of human ingenuity. This is where people congregate and come up with new ways to do things. The more the people, the more the ideas, and the more people get to evolve those ideas by discussing them with the people around them. I think that the major cities have played a huge role in human evolution, physically, emotionally, and mentally. Big cities give us a cesspool of almost all societies tops and bottoms, and looking at them we would be able to see societies characteristics best.
A3UTFL5JHRQCM1	essay3	Scandals can act as a focal point for problems because they usually involve someone of high status. People are, for the most part, attracted to the drama that a scandal can bring and impose on society. It gives us all a common enemy and makes us all think as like minded individuals, making us feel closer. Even though great speakers and reformers have a good chance at swaying the public, I don't think it reaches the peak that a scandal can have. Especially in today's world where we have smart phone and the internet where we can voice out opinions immediately.
A3VHDQR8A9JJ4F	essay1	I slightly agree with this issue. I think with everyone having access to search engines such as google it really takes away our need to even think about a question. We just automatically say to ourselves let me google that. I think it takes away from us actually trying to learn and figure out the answers to our questions and put us in a more of a lazy automatic mode. On the flip side it does help us in a way that we can save time by getting the answers we need faster so that it could be spent on other methods of learning and understanding.
A3VHDQR8A9JJ4F	essay2	You have to look at the cities and see how they people act and behave in order to find out just what society is like for the majority of american citizens. We can learn a lot about culture and understanding by observing these cities and finding out just how people behave in today's world. Because of the big population in major cities i find it would be easiest to study them because the more people the more we can study about how society  really is and how people are treated fairly and unfairly.
A3VHDQR8A9JJ4F	essay3	I agree with this statement just because with a scandal there is no cover up. You know all the dirty details that a lot of people would never put out there to fit there politically correct agenda. It really reveals the deepest and darkest secrets of how people live their lives and gives you the real version of them instead of the fake politically correct version that they put on for the media to portray them as a person that they aren't.
A3VXVW6ABB3PC1	essay1	I agree that technology is deteriorating the human ability to solve problems.  Simple tasks, such as adding and subtracting, are done in a few seconds on our phone.  GPS technology has taken over our own sense of direction.  People can simply ask SIRI or ALEXA any question and immediately get answer instead of researching and learning about the topic.  Technology makes complex problems easy to solve by a quick search on the internet.  Children play video games and text and use social media instead of interacting face to face and developing strong communication skills. YouTube and other video sites allow for instant instruction or tutorials on things that we might be better off to solve for ourselves.  I feel like technology has definitely
A3VXVW6ABB3PC1	essay2	To understand the most important characteristics of a society I think you should not only study it's major cities, but also other areas that may be less populated.  A major city provides many aspects of life in one consolidated area so a large number of factors can be considered in a fairly small area.  But, one must take into consideration that city life is one type of living, while country life is another.  A banker in a major city is very different than a farmer 100 miles outside of the city, but both represent the society equally.  Different ways of living represent the society and one must not only seek out city dwellers, but also more rural areas to understand a society.
A3VXVW6ABB3PC1	essay3	Scandals can be useful because the attention they draw far outweighs what a speaker or reformer could do.  Scandals can bring attention to issues that many people in society may not otherwise pay attention to.  They can also spark debate which can then in turn create change.  Sometimes, the change can be for the better or possibly it could be for the worse.  Scandals get media attention and the media can sometimes create more out of the situation than what is really there. Scandals can bring about outrage or support, but ultimately they help our society take a stance and fight for what we believe in.
A3W24IE6P9O302	essay1	I do not agree with this statement. I have two degrees in web design and some outside knowledge in programming and  I realize the other side of the argument. There will always need to be people to teach the technology. That is why I got into IT. I know that humans have it easier by being able to ask google something rather than look it up in a book, but this is because a human already did the work to put it into the databases that are google.
A3W24IE6P9O302	essay2	I do agree with this statement. I agree with it because to understand something you have to take a sample from the whole. Often the sample will be the people in the major cities. This is the best way to understand their society, because this is where the people are. If you go into a small community you possibly would not get a good representation of the majority. Without a good sample you will get bad data.
A3W24IE6P9O302	essay3	I do not agree with this statement. The reason I do not agree is because even if a scandal opens our eyes it is still a scandal. A scandal is a bad thing, and it does not become good because it does something such as expose something bad. The act of fixing something is good. However, we should not need to rely on a scandal to be able to see something that is wrong. I have never personally heard of a useful scandal.
A3W4MAKNDI1SXM	essay1	I absolutely agree with this statement that as people rely more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate.  You see it everyday.  People cannot function without their cell phone/tablet/computer.  They use it for the easiest task, as well as the hardest ones.  They rely less on using their mind to come up with answers and instead refer to their electronic device and find out the answers to everything.  Its sad to see, how even the children of the world today are glued to these devices.  Lots of parents use them as babysitters to keep their kids entertained, instead of
A3W4MAKNDI1SXM	essay2	I live in one of the greatest cities in the world, New York.  NY is a melting pot of the world. People from all different parts of the world come here to visit, to live, to work and to play. If you were to study New York, you would see that the people are diverse, worldly, educated,, fair and open minded.  The people that reside in a city, can tell you alot about this socie
A3W4MAKNDI1SXM	essay3	I don't feel that scandals are useful.  While they do focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could, they can be very dangerous and ruin lives.  It is very sad to see what a scandal has done to some people. They feel they have no other alternative other than to take their own life.  In addition, we usually do not need to know all of the gritty details that go along with the scandal.  Some things are better off being private.
A4Y0U84ELE1EK	essay1	As human beings our reliance on technology has become almost absolute. We need GPS to guide us places, google searches to tell us where to eat, and Facebook messenger to communicate with each other. It's hard to believe how much we have come to depend on the internet in such a short time. What started as just a fun thing to play a game or enter a chat room, has become our total self image and what we think of first when we want to do something new. Review sites like Yelp tell us where to eat. Groupon and other sites lead us to experiences or hotels, based on where we can get the best deal. Google Maps leads us to wherever we want to go, and tells us the best way to get there. Even just having a cell phone has caused most people to forget all but the most important telephone numbers. Technology is a blessing and a curse.
A4Y0U84ELE1EK	essay2	The major cities of the world are true indicators of diversity. They are the melting pot where many different cultures and peoples come together to try and 'make it.' In my experience, larger cities, being more diverse are more open to strangers and new things. What i've found in my travels is that smaller scale cities, while friendly to someone like me, a white person, are not so welcoming to people of color or from different nations. They are the true indicators of what a society believes, and show it through their actions and political statements.
A4Y0U84ELE1EK	essay3	Scandals are absolutely not useful. Far from it. Scandals are used to distract us from the bigger issues and challenges that face our world today. Instead of focusing on climate change, wars, or starving people, we care about who cheated on whom, or which person lied on their taxes. It is the curse of our modern day society. Our American society are full of these types of people, and they live with their heads in the sand. Better to focus on scandals to them, then to actually pay attention and learn about the true tragedies that take place in the world.
A510DQA9ROBC6	essay1	I definitely agree with this statement. The most simplest example of this is the calculator. The more we rely on the calculator, the less effort we have to put into mentally coming up with the answers to mathematical questions. Everything is becoming so automated that it requires very little mental effort to function. It's understandable that we, as a species, want to progress and make daily things easier, but there is a fine line between progression and regression. The more progress we make, specifically with technology, the more likely it is that future generations are dumber as a result.
A510DQA9ROBC6	essay2	This may or may not be true. Populated cities can tell a lot about a society's characteristics, sure, but that doesn't mean we should ignore more rural areas. These places may be less populated, but it's still an important wealth of information. A smaller percentage of people like to live in less populated areas. However, studying large cities does allow for a higher percentage of detail and information. There is a reason why cities, especially places like Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, are highly populated.
A510DQA9ROBC6	essay3	Scandals definitely bring attention to societal issues, because it provides undeniable proof that a certain problem exists. A speaker/reformer can talk about these things and why they are a problem, but a surefire way to prove that the problem exists is if a scandal erupts to drive the point home. Reality is more convincing than hypothetical situations described to us by speakers. The most prevalent scandal that comes to mind is the case against Bill Cosby. Had his crimes not been brought out into the public, no one would have cared or even believed it had happened.
A5ET25WTBJC0J	essay1	I do not believe technology is deteriorating human thinking. I believe that humans now have more information available then ever and are becoming smarter. With this wealth of information at our finger tips we can process more and become more informed. With this much information people can make much better judgments on issues and really see what the best course of action to take is. I believe humans are becoming smarter overall and that is all thanks to the technology that we developed.
A5ET25WTBJC0J	essay2	I do not think you will understand all of society by just focusing on the major cities. The world is a very big place and you need to study all the areas to fully understand it. There is a lot of knowledge to be obtained from rural and suburban societies. By just focusing on major cities you are leaving out to much of the culture to make a informed decision. There are very important characteristics that are found outside of major cities that need to be included to understand everything about society.
A5ET25WTBJC0J	essay3	I do believe that scandals are important.  They are good because it makes people look at a situation and understand how something happens. You can then use your understanding of the scandal to prevent whatever bad happened from happening again. Scandals are polarizing and people want to see how they play out and focus there attention on them. Overall i feel they have a part in society and we can ultimately learn new information because of them.
A5X1KZ9CCHREK	essay1	As technology grows we must educate ourselves with the technology. Some jobs will disappear but other will open up. I believe this is people's biggest fear because the job people knows all their life will be gone. But through education they can use that to grow with the technology to find better job. I disagree with the statement because it's all about education , determination and the willingness to grow with technology.
A5X1KZ9CCHREK	essay2	I disagree with this statement because to understand the characteristic of society you must understand society in whole. Reasoning for this , society moves around, inner mixing with each other, so this say that we must understand major cities is false. We must understand certain social groups and the dynamics of the population to get the better handle on characteristics of the populations.
A5X1KZ9CCHREK	essay3	I disagree with this issue because scandals is based on falsehoods and half truths. To understand a situation we must have facts. Scandals are just what it says. It is like theories, we just don't know if its true or not. But facts are based on evidence, and facts cannot be disputed. Society needs this scandals to feel complete and have some sort of drama in their life but for some people who can look through the wish wash can see the facts of the situation. .
A66DYECFB1OJ4	essay1	I partially agree with the statement. I do believe that the ability for some humans to think for themselves will deteriorate.  Some people will decide to use their extra time on mindless filler from TV or media therefore limiting their ability to think for themselves.  The ability deterioration will much depend on the choice of the each individual. Another way to look at the issue to say the more problems technology can solve, the more time one will have to think abstractly, therefore increases the ability to think for oneself.  This group of individuals will no doubt develop more ideas and more technology to move society along.
A66DYECFB1OJ4	essay2	I disagree with statement.  To understand the most important characteristics of society, one must study more that just the large cities.  Many individuals live in suburban and rural areas and these individuals have voting power and can influence the lives of many.  The U.S. is a great example.  Across the Midwest and South there are millions who don't live in major cities, but still have tremendous impact on the laws in the states they live in. Iowa and Texas are great examples of this.   If a person wants to understand urban life or society that exists in metropolitan areas, then certainly major cities should be studied, but for a society as a whole, all groups must be taken into account.
A66DYECFB1OJ4	essay3	Scandals can be good depending on the nature of the scandal and how it impacts society.  The sexual assault allegations against individuals like Bill Cosby are certainly good because they allow an oppressed group a voice and normalize speaking out against oppression.  Scandals like an actor getting a divorce because he was cheating with the nanny, on the other hand, are time wasters and fill up our time with mindless info. Unfortunately, media uses some scandals to blind the eyes of individuals to other, newsworthy stories, that could truly change our society.
A69MJ072PH13	essay1	I agree with the statement that as people rely more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate. If you go to the store and your total is 8.35 and you give the cashier $10, she punches the amount in and the register tells her how much to give back to you. While the drawer is open you decide you want to give her .10 to get .75 back in change. She is flabbergasted and does not know what to do. How many people actually know important telephone numbers? I am guilty of this. When I want to call someone I just hit the button for mom, dad, sister, brother, husband etc. With the exception of my husband's number if there was an emergency and I couldn't use my cell phone for phone numbers I would be in big trouble.
A69MJ072PH13	essay2	I do not agree with the statement to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities. Let us take Boston for an example. Boston is a huge city and there are so many different ways of living in that city. So the cities around it are not going to be matched to one way of life. So looking at just the big cities is not going to give you the clear picture of a society. You need to look at the big cities and small towns to truly understand.
A69MJ072PH13	essay3	Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could is absolutely true. You would never know about a doctor treating non cancerous patients for cancer and then curing them without the scandal being brought out. Nobody is going to want to come out against the doctor to do or say something. But there is always that one person that will come out and get it out in the open. Then all the attention comes to the issue and something an actually get done.
A6MWJK1YEY5L2	essay1	As technology becomes better and better I am inclined to agree with this statement. With something as simple as the invention of Wikipedia and other ways of quickly obtaining information we've already seen a decline in people thinking for themselves. Why should a person bother to do so when the answer is a simple word and click away? When we create things that take the thought out of a process we no longer have a need to know how that process happens. It's just done for us. This is basically the double edged sword of progression.
A6MWJK1YEY5L2	essay2	Studying all sizes of cities is important for understanding characteristics of a society. While studying large cities is very important this leaves out and entire group of people who are just as important. An example would be 100s or thousands of years from now something  catastrophic happened and the people of that time are trying to figure out how the people lived, how their society worked. By just looking at a large city you do learn a lot but you leave out how that city interacted with the nearby town. You miss out on how that city got its food because there's no way it was able to produce enough food for everyone. By only examining large cities you leave large gaps. Cultural communities can exist that you would never know about, agian something from our time, you would never know about some of the Native american reserves or national reserves in general.
A6MWJK1YEY5L2	essay3	"While scandals are definitely detrimental they do in fact bring into light things that we may not have thought of that should be addressed. The inherent issue is the exposure of the scandal. By definition a scandal is an event that is generally morally or legally wrong and causes public outrage. What this means is that something terribly wrong happened and it was found out and exposed. You could have something terrible like a pharmaceutical company selling fake drugs and without the ""scandal"" that s the exposure, other companies could do the same thing and not feel obligated by morals or law. It means we aren't making an example of them so they may be more tempted to try it themselves."
A6N190372TE5T	essay1	I disagree with the statement that humans will lose the ability to think for themselves as we rely on technology more. Technology is valuable in many ways and serves a purpose to assist us. Yes, it can solve problems so that we don't have to, but that can make us more productive. Technology helps people learn more about different subjects can make humans more educated. Additionally, having tools at your disposal to help you solve problems can help you accomplish more.
A6N190372TE5T	essay2	I agree that is important to study major cities in order to understand society better. Major cities are the most diverse areas in the world. Learning about the people that inhabit those cities and how the communities function can help people understand society. You simply cannot understand society as a whole by looking at smaller towns and rural areas. These areas do not have the diversity or minorities in the way that major cities do.
A6N190372TE5T	essay3	I agree that scandals focus people's attentions on problems more than a speaker or reformer ever could. As passionate as people may be about issues, they just can't get other people to care as much as they do on their words alone. A scandal or a big news story puts the issue on a bigger platform that draws in a wider audience. When an issue is connected to a story that people can have an emotional connection to, they will care about the issue. A speaker or reformer can't get that connection to people in a way that a story can.
A7I3G380E29VE	essay1	Technology is a great way to assist in solving problems. With computing power getting stronger each year more complex problems can be solved faster than ever before. This being said I believe this will not hinder the ability of humans to think for themselves. I believe it can even help people get more information to form better opinions. There are now multiple avenues to get information at the touch of a button. This allows people to get broader perspectives on issues that wasn't possible in the past. With this information people can build their own opinions based on all the different information they've learned. This would actually help humans think for themselves.
A7I3G380E29VE	essay2	Major cities are a vibrant source of societies characteristics. Large cities host a diverse group of people ranging from: people living, working, visiting the city. This is a great place to study the important characteristics of society because of this diversity. In smaller cities you don't get such a diverse group because the population in made up of people living in the same means and jobs. People from all walks of life in major cities making a nice sample size more true to the characteristics of the society.
A7I3G380E29VE	essay3	Scandals are good in that they can bring to attention to a large portion of populations problems that exist in our society that they might not think about. Scandals also bring the problems close to home making us more aware of the problems that exist. Speakers and reformers are good, however, they only seem to bring together people who are already lived the problems. Scandals instead can enlighten a large group of the population who may never have considered there was a problem to begin with.
A7OY2DNQAQ73P	essay1	While it is true that human reliance on technology for menial tasks may result in the deterioration of the abilities used to complete those tasks (as it already has for handwriting in some cases), I disagree with the premise that technology will cause humans ability to think for themselves to deteriorate. As technology becomes more integrated into our civilization and culture, it tends to augment our abilities, rather than merely replace them. It is possible that incorporating technology in such a way that humans are freed from the need to think about lower order things (e.g. rudimentary calculations; survival issues like obtaining food, shelter, and clothing; thoughts involving day-to-day labor) it may open them up to being able to focus entirely on more profound thoughts.
A7OY2DNQAQ73P	essay2	As the primary hubs of trade, culture, and production, and the largest social spaces where the aforementioned qualities of societies can form and progress, it is absolutely essential that major cities be studied in order to grasp the most important characteristic of a society. Many of the most promising insights regarding prehistoric human civilizations have come from the systematic archaeological and anthropological study of the remains of cities, like those of Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, or the Indus Valley civilization. There are common elements to all cities that dictate that the greatest advances in human flourishing occur within them, like proximity to large bodies of water and fertile land, an accumulation of large and diverse populations, and the infrastructure necessary for large-scale productive activity.
A7OY2DNQAQ73P	essay3	I believe that scandals are useful for focusing our attention, but disagree that no speaker or reformer could accomplish such attention-grabbing to the same degree. History is rife with examples of orators and activists that were able to drive masses of people to action, merely by their fine grasp of the social and material conditions that existed in the place and time of which they were a part. It was through their ability to draw a crowd and command the attention of whole nations or the world that they could accomplish such feats, without the need to rely on some indiscretion of theirs or another to focus that attention.
A8KX1HFH8NE2Q	essay1	"I disagree with the position that as more people relay on technology that the ability of humans to think for themselves will decrease.   As a technologist myself, I see the detailed thinking that has to go into technology design on a daily basis.  Many of the algorithms and coding represents highly advanced thinking and requires individuals with skills that cut across a variety of domains.   I also believe that the users of the technology will always have an inherent level of curiosity which I believe is a basic aspect of the human personality.   We have all experienced young children who repeatedly ask ""why"" after each explanation to a previous question - and I believe that humans continue to operate that way and are always asking ""why"" as well.    Thus, I am very comfortable that from both the perspective of the designer and the user that technology is only challenging us to advance our thinking skills to a higher level."
A8KX1HFH8NE2Q	essay2	"I agree that in order to understand the most important characteristics of a society that one must study its major cities.   I think that each of our major cities is similar to an individual human in that the city has a unique personality that is not reflected in any other city.   Thus, I think that one must look across all of our cities in order to truly understand the broad cross-section of society.   Our cities have individual characteristics and personalities and when one aggregates them together into a broader group, then society can truly be understood.   Just as in a group, where there are always specific group dynamics between individuals and smaller groups, that same relationship exists with our cities where there are ""city dynamics"" between different cities in terms of how they relate and view each other.   One should look at the entire group of cities to understand these dynamics but at the same time, one should also study the individual city to understand its unique personality and characteristics."
A8KX1HFH8NE2Q	essay3	I agree that some scandals are useful for focusing our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.   However, I also believe that some scandals lead to extreme sadness when we realize that those conditions existed for months or even years without anyone taking action to correct the situation.   I do think that scandals are important for society in that they ensure that those conditions never occur in any other situation after the scandal has been exposed.  In that way, the scandal is probably more effective than any regulation or law which might not get the visibility or the exposure of the scandal.   In my own situation though, I would always prefer to take action before the situation escalates into a scandal as there is always a stigma that one has to live with for the rest of their life if they have been involved in a scandal.   For that reason alone, I would prefer to avoid the scandal entirely but if the scandal does occur, then I'm willing to consider the positive benefits that the scandal can contribute to society.
A8OE2E20OZYKI	essay1	I do believe that people are relying too much on technology and their intelligence is declining as a result. It's so easy to just look up an answer to something that people just aren't memorizing facts. I know this because I am guilty of it as well. If something were to happen to our technology I believe that most people wouldn't be able to function as well. Overall I believe that people should work more towards thinking of answers to questions and memorizing things, rather than just taking out their smart phone, giving an answer to the question, and forgetting what they looked up immediately.
A8OE2E20OZYKI	essay2	I agree that by studying major cities we can understand society. Large cities offer large groups of people that can be studied. This can be as simple as doing a traffic study to see how people get around, or by asking people their opinion on general questions in order to get a better understanding of them. Through these studies I believe we can better understand how society works. Basically more people means more of a chance to study the society that they make up. And by studying multiple cities we can learn more about different societies and how those people go about their day to day lives.
A8OE2E20OZYKI	essay3	I agree that scandals can be useful. They usually bring to light issues that we didn't even know that we had. By revealing these issues in the form of a scandal, we are forced to do something about it. Speakers and reformers can only go so far if they don't even know what's going on beneath the surface. And that's why scandals are useful; they force issues into the public light, and they force us to deal with them. Without scandals these problems would never be solved and the people making them worse would continue to get away with doing whatever it is that they're doing.
A90NKJUJ7HTEQ	essay1	As a parent, it is a huge concern of mine that people are relying more heavily on technology using less brain power to think for themselves.  I see my children not retaining information I would consider important for simple life skills and I feel that this is due to the lack of things that they need to remember as they have the items at their fingertips via technology.  For example not one of them knows their own phone number or the friend's numbers that they may need.  In an emergency situation, this could be dire.  The simple task of knowing a phone number could be a huge asset if the technology you relied on was not available.
A90NKJUJ7HTEQ	essay2	Understanding the characteristics of society does not require a study of societies in major cities.  While there is a true reflection of a dense quantity of people located in these areas it is not the entire picture of what society is made up of.  I think that you need to look at civilization as a whole as many people choose not to live in these areas for many reasons.  Some of which include not sharing the views of these people located there.  And the people who do not live in these areas are equally valuable references for society.
A90NKJUJ7HTEQ	essay3	Scandals are not useful as they distract from issues that truly need attention.  Most often times I feel like when there is a scandal it detracts attention away from where the attention is really needed.  Most often it is a scandal that is being sold by the media because it sells and makes their networks the most money.  When there are more pressing issues the focus remains the politician that behaved poorly or did something wrong instead of an issue like equality or conservation.
AA4JYAPLYB6QT	essay1	Thinking back to before when had google at our finger tips, information was much harder to access. You often could not find niche information in a library, usually. Or it required extensive searching. Now we have access to the collective conscious of human intelligence at our finger tips, literally almost any where we are in the world.   Now imagine being reliant on receiving information through the internet for all your life but it's suddenly all taken away.
AA4JYAPLYB6QT	essay2	The difference in culture can vary greatly from city to city in different countries. For example, I spent 2 years in Shanghai China studying Chinese. Shanghai is more of a western influenced, modern city. They are generally accepting of foreigners, because there is a high influx of tourists in this area.  Beijing on the other hand, is a little different. A lot of people from rural china come to Beijing and they don't often see foreigners, so you will often catch people staring, or perhaps they might even come up to you and ask for a photograph together. All in all they mostly seem curious. A huge difference in culture and attitudes.
AA4JYAPLYB6QT	essay3	I can recall one particular incident where this holds true. Martin Shkreli, co-founder of the hedge funds Elea Capital. Accused up hiking up the price of a precious life saving drug for aids patients. This was a sickening incident. But it brought to light, to the mass population the issues of pharmaceutical companies inflating their prices for vital, and some times life saving drugs.
AA4KKLIU4C3NY	essay1	Technology has come a long way since the advent of man.  From stone age man with primitive tools to the Middle Ages where man developed weaponry of sorts and built great monuments until today, where we can do everything on a tiny smartphone.  Technology has helped us immensely in making our lives easier and more convenient while saving time in the process.  Yet, does technology have any effect on our ability to think for ourselves?  I think not.  Technology helps to support us and make our lives more convenient and easy.  But thinking for ourselves has never really been the human strong point.  Throughout history man has failed to truly think for himself, instead joining the masses and following along in the common thought consciousness of the day.  Thus, I don't believe technological breakthroughs have any ill effect on man's ability to think for himself.
AA4KKLIU4C3NY	essay2	If an alien from another universe landed on our planet and studied our major cities, they might catch a glimpse of some of the things we hold dear.  Some of our societal characteristics surely shine through our major cities in things like the technology of skyscrapers, our total dependence on mass transit and automobiles, the prevalence of factories and big business and capitalism as the lifeblood of our current world.  However, are these things really our most important characteristics or just some of them?  Are not things like compassion, love, charity and goodwill truly our most important characteristics, our most time-treasured characteristics of all?  Would we necessarily see these while viewing our largest metropolises?  I think not.  Some characteristics might be observed but hardly our most beloved ones.
AA4KKLIU4C3NY	essay3	Who could disagree that the latest mega-scandal about some company or organization doesn't grab people's imaginations and morning coffee hour's banter?  People read the headlines, watch the news and converse over the latest scandalous topic, sometimes for weeks at a time.  Yet, what are the results of these events in the big picture of things?  Do the fundamental problems underlying these scandalous items ever truly get resolved after all the dust has settled?  Can we really say that scandals alone are responsible for solving society's ills more effectively than great speakers and leaders who march and speak and advocate on the subjects?  I hardly think so.  While the latest scandal may grab society's attention in a shocking and spectacular way, the consistency of a speaker's speeches and advocacy go much further to resolving and solving the fundamental issues at play.
AADRVG2QVZH75	essay1	I do not believe that with the advent of more tech that the human beings ability to think for themselves will be diminished in any way.  If anything I think it's the exact opposite.  Being able to rely on tech to answer needless information leaves our brains open to store more of the information that we actually want to know.  It gives us more room to be able to think creatively because our brains are not being stuffed to capacity with useless information.  For instance, instead of using working memory to recall phone numbers or addresses or figure a tip, we can simply look them up on our phone.  This in turn frees up brain power to make more important decisions.  This is why I believe that we will actually show advancement as our technology grows because we will no longer have to be trash receptacles for information that we don't need to remember on a daily basis.
AADRVG2QVZH75	essay2	When thinking that a society's major characteristics can be found only by studying it's major cities, you are greatly undermining the diversity of that society.  There are vast and huge differences among every society between cities and more rural/suburban areas.  To understand the characteristics of a society you need to view the whole as being a sum of all of it's parts.  You wouldn't sum up America just by going to New York and California.  What would visiting those areas tell you about Texas or Colorado?  You have to examine every single aspect of a society to even decide what the most important characteristics are.  If you don't, you are more than likely missing half of them.
AADRVG2QVZH75	essay3	Scandals are immensely useful because they do focus our attention on problems we usually ignore.  When one person is standing among the crowd saying that something is an issue they are often scoffed at.  If a scandal breaks out around the same issue, people are up in arms about it.  This is because we put a lot of value in social norms.  When something goes against these norms it gets our attention and works us up as a group.  And where there's a group, there are more willing to follow.  We aim to please and we want to belong.  It's an unfortunate but true aspect of humanity.
AAF1SJ9FCBF75	essay1	Even as people become more and more dependent on technology to solve problems, they will not lose their ability to think for themselves.   They will just devote their mental energies to different areas.   There are always new problems to think about, and someone has to take care of the machines.    Also people may have the technology used to augment their brain capacities.  they will spend more time pursuing art.
AAF1SJ9FCBF75	essay2	One must study both the major cities and the rural areas to understand the most important characteristics of a society.  Neither is more important than the other.  Often one will find a great contrast between the two, and studying just one would leave out a lot of the picture.  Sure a lot of the action seems to take place in the city, but what about the growing of food?  The city is important in that you can find quite the assortment of people all there in that one area, whereas those over the countryside may seem more similar to each other.
AAF1SJ9FCBF75	essay3	"We may say that scandals are ""useful"" because after the fact we can use them to improve things,  However, they are not  necessary to bring about reform, and certainly not the best way to do it.  It would be much better to avoid them altogether.   That's just an excuse to encourage bad behavior instead of trying to prevent it.   I always hated the saying that ""all publicity is good publicity"" or however it goes.  I think that quite the opposite is true - good publicity is good, and bad publicity is much worse than none at all.    Who wants to"
AAJC9VIP5DOP	essay1	In an time where you can find an app for everything and a short cut to most tasks, people will loose their ability to think and reason for themselves. Using a calculator reduces the ability to keep math facts  memorized. If a calculator can effect our ability to retain math facts, isn't it logical that devices that think for us in other ways will do the same. I doubt there are many people who know more  than five phone numbers. Twenty years ago people knew ten, twenty, maybe even more by heart because they needed to.  Technology is great, but letting it take the place of our brain power may be a negative in the long run.
AAJC9VIP5DOP	essay2	Large cities may be where the largest percentages of populations are, but the heart of a society lies in the more rural areas. To understand the fabric of society you must understand what is most important to it. You won't find that in cities, you will find people bustling and living a life at a break neck speed. In more rural areas you will find the people who ground the society in what matters most. So to learn the most important characteristics of a society, you should focus on the rural areas and smaller cities.  You will see a rich diversity linked by similar stories.
AAJC9VIP5DOP	essay3	Scandals actually take our focus off of what is important and keep our attention of gossip and sensationalism. Scandals are rarely about important issues of our time. Even if the initial scandal was caused by an issue that needs reform, to keep the attention of viewers and readers, news sources begin to showcase the cheap and tawdry. They push rumors and add drama where there is none. This is the problem with fast moving 24 hour news. They have to fill time and space. Important issues are given little time and even less thought and fast food news gets pushed to the top.
AAYL7UAXO9E4T	essay1	I believe that this is certainly true, but only in some facets of human life.  Technology has made our lives easier as human beings, the autonomous features that many cell phones, cars, and computers now hold, are very easy to rely on, saving both time, and effort, for human beings.  When it comes to GPS directions, maps, lists, reminders, those features are very important.  But that also gives time back to humans for other things to get done in their lives, making our lives easier and also being able to get more done.  This is especially true for those of us with families.  To be able to focus on more important things outside of being able to remember what groceries to buy, or where to drive, it gives us as humans a great advantage for the future.
AAYL7UAXO9E4T	essay2	I think there is a big difference between big cities, and small cities, that studying just big cities to get a grasp on the most important characteristics of a society, is short sighted.  Many people outside the city, believe different things, handle their lives differently (whether right or wrong), than those inside of the city.  Values can be different, importance of time management may be different, and the overall outlook on life between the two landscapes is different.  So to study just the inside of major cities would not complete the whole picture of society and how it works and the characteristics involved.  The overall picture must be taken into account.
AAYL7UAXO9E4T	essay3	Scandals can certainly focus on issues that people have, and bring them to light for the betterment of society.  But it also can cause distrust between people, between societies, and between the overall human race.  This is tough, I can see both sides of the issue.  But I truly believe if we as humans would live more clean lives, then scandals wouldn't be a part of it.  That is not feasible though, so for scandals to come out and point the light on some of the dirty things that happen in society, we as a human race can clean it up and punish those responsible, hoping to prevent repeat scandals in the future.
AB774I47XHB4K	essay1	i will say that I agree the way that people are over reliant on phones and the internet will spell doom for humans and their ability to think for them selves and if the internet ever goes out it might be a national crisis on a large scale
AB774I47XHB4K	essay2	i would agree looking at the large cities you can have a look at the hive mind mentality that humans live off of and you will see how they will push back against any thing that is different from them

AC0T7AM0QTWN5	essay1	Technology has helped humanity out tremendously. We rely on it on a daily basis. However, it has impaired our ability to do certain tasks by ourselves. One of these things is basic math. We rely on calculators. Also, people are unwilling to work hard physically as I believe they once were. If technology ever failed us, we would be (as a whole) very out of shape and it would take a lot of will power to make us do things that we once viewed as necessary, such as hand washing dishes and clothes. I believe that humans want to be as lazy as possible, but unfortunately with the extra time we have we are filling our minds with unnecessary information. We watched more television and don't care about developing ourselves physically.
AC0T7AM0QTWN5	essay2	In our cities we can find the most diverse populations. It is in cities that the brightest minds tend to work and study. We see the best and worst of people when we are forced to be in close proximity to others, because we cannot hide our personalities or behaviors. We see the strange things people do, and the thoughts that others possess. People work together to live along side one another with the least possible inconvenience, and try to enjoy each others company. We see more negative sides too, such as what happens when someone feels like they aren't competing well with others.
AC0T7AM0QTWN5	essay3	When scandals break out and become public knowledge, it forces everyone to do something about it. My personal definition of a scandal is when someone does something bad (or fails to do something that should have been done), and then everyone starts talking about it. This is usually because of the media making a big deal about it. Once people start talking about the same thing, usually something gets done about it. If someone were to just speak about something, it is likely that not many people would care to listen. It's a shame that it usually takes something very bad happening to have people come together and make change.

ACDTQNYOT3GG8	essay1	With the advent of new technology life has been easier. A lot has been said and done to highlight the implication of technology on basic human nature. The most harmful impact has been satiated attitude that human race has developed, thanks to innumerable Apps and inventions that is at our disposal. Therefore, it is imperative for human race to rely less on technology and more on manual efforts to build up the brain muscle.  The problem lies in reasoning of an individual which gets halted thanks to what thehuman brain faces with simple click. Yes ‘the simple click/tap’ that generates a simple yes or displays complex results in matter of seconds. Human brain stops questioning the how? and Why?, affecting its critical ability to perceive things.
ACDTQNYOT3GG8	essay2	The argument that to understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities is a narrow-minded approach to truly understand a society. While it is logical to study cities as these have the highest concentration of population, such an approach ignores the small towns, and rural areas that also make up the society.  For a country, such as India, where more than 70 per cent of people live in rural areas, studying just the cities will give one an incomplete picture of how the society is. Major cities offer the most visible characteristics of a society, modern or historical, real or fantastic. They are usually the political, financial and social capitals of a society. When we are trying to get a superficial understanding of a society, it is the city which provides us a view of the fast-paced, ever-changing political, financial, technological or social spheres, all of which are situated in major cities. However, to gain a deeper understanding of a society or rather, the relatively permanent aspects of a society, we must also investigate into minor cities, towns, villages.
ACDTQNYOT3GG8	essay3	For one, scandals often involve cases of moral deviation or selfishness and are not   problems that need active reforming. They may reflect on society as a whole but cannot, through their occurrence, bring much change for the better. For example, the case of Petraeus and his extramarital affair was considered extremely scandalous, particularly because the general was a high-ranking official whose judgments affected many thousands of lives daily. However, though the media portrayal was particularly unpleasant, the actual attention on the affair probably did not bring much reform people's stances on their marital lives. They might be more careful but the scandal itself did not bring much change. This can be seen from the continued focus on such affairs in reality and in television programming.
ACK1HEO9MGFQL	essay1	As technology advances, life for the everyday person and business is in a constant state of change. With this change brings countless benefits, such as the ability to focus on more complex tasks while technology takes care of many more simple tasks. However, there are also drawbacks to this change, such as the fact that humans are becoming less versed in face-to-face and manual skills. These skills include handwriting, computing numbers, social interactions, and being able to survive in the event of a widespread outage or disaster. It is important that humans make efforts to maintain such manual skills even as they learn to use more advanced technologies.
ACK1HEO9MGFQL	essay2	A society can be defined succinctly as a community of people whom have agreed to live together more or less in a state of unity and cohesiveness. There are many important aspects and pieces of a society, and in order to truly understand the larger society itself it is important to examine each of these aspects. One such important aspect is that of a society's major cities. These contain the largest proportion per square mile of the society's individual citizens, businesses, shopping centers, advertisements, widely-used public transit systems, and government centers. They also tend to afford a mixture of cultures and ideals that make up the society due to the large concentration of people they contain. While major cities are a vital area of study of a society, they are not the only area. It is important to also pay attention to the more rural or sparsely-settled areas to get a feel for the society's local culture - that is, how people organize themselves and relate to each other in a more personal environment. In addition, with the rise of technology and social media today, many more people are communicating ideas over the Internet and thus it is equally important to consider technological means as vessels of the society's characteristics.
ACK1HEO9MGFQL	essay3	A scandal is best defined as an event which goes against a society's perceptions of right versus wrong, legal versus illegal, or some similar criterion, and which causes public outrage. Scandals, while they typically mean that a serious wrong has been committed against a group of people or entity which may take a long time to be rectified, also can serve a helpful purpose in a society. This is because scandals draw the public's attention to topics which otherwise may not be brought to the light. They expose corruption, faults in legal or financial systems, political concerns, and a myriad of other potential situations on which it is important for the public to take action. There are, of course, many ways in which to get out an important message to a society; many recent activists and public speakers have done just that, and they serve a vital role. However, it is important not to dismiss negative events such as scandals which occur as being purely detrimental; they also serve an underlying positive function and can help make a society better for all.
ACSS93E03ZUGX	essay1	I wholeheartedly agree with the statement. Being able to rely on technology to do a lot of things we once had to do with our own brains has definitely put humans at a disadvantage. For instance, when I was in grade school, I was a phenomenal speller. I could spell practically any word given to me and I even won a district spelling bee. Now, however, I have forgotten how to spell a ton of the words because of my reliance on spell check. I fear things only get worse.
ACSS93E03ZUGX	essay2	I somewhat agree with the statement. Different cities carry a lot of different cultures and therefore shape the societies. Generally people behave the same in certain cities. A lot of stereotypes come from that but a lot of them hold to be true. I think it would be beneficial to know cities if you are doing something like advertising so you would know your market.
ACSS93E03ZUGX	essay3	I disagree with the statement. Scandals are not only not useful they are psychologically damaging. Sometimes people need to mind their own business and just let people live their lives. The only reason scandals are so popular is because average people lead such dull boring lives that they need something to do. By putting someone down who made a mistake it makes them feel better about themselves. Reporting on a scandal should be illegal.
ACVEFRSUAPSEQ	essay1	Technology is great. As it evolves, it has made life much better for the majority of people with access to it. However, it does make people lazier too. People allow technology to do the thinking for them. Young people who have had modern technology their entire lives find it hard to count change to a person when a register is not working properly, cannot write in cursive, and rely on Google for their homework assignments. Technology is great, indeed, but people need to use their own brains too. What is not used will atrophy!
ACVEFRSUAPSEQ	essay2	Major cities are home to many different styles of people. City slickers, country bumpkins, and everyone in between can call a major city home for one reason or another. To get all walks of life together in one city is to know a bit about each one. Most people will fight for what they believe in. This can be done by voting for the politicians who create and change policy to living out their values on a daily basis. Since so many different walks of life are found in major cities, it makes sense to study these cities to find out what people hold near and dear to their hearts.
ACVEFRSUAPSEQ	essay3	Some scandals may allow our attention to be focused on the right issues, but the majority of them just cause chaos and confusion. For a scandal to exist, someone has done something wrong. Rather than let the media run rampant with the story, those people with power should nip the scandal in the bud. People involved should face consequences. The scandal should not take the focus off an important issue and onto drama, as most do. Scandals should be quietly handled, consequences dealt with, and the issues that are important should stay in the forefront.
ACVJ6IUO9QM4R	essay1	"I agree with the statement of ""As people rely more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate"". I  agree with the statement because of the overwhelming evidence of this already being the case with millenials. Millenials are extremely dependent upon the internet for things such as school, work, banking, and even leisure activities such as gaming, watching videos, streaming music, that it seems as though they've almost forgotten that there is a life outside of the internet! When you take the technology away from them, they freak out and have no idea how to function without the technology. As a 90s kid, we didn't have internet for a long time, or cell phones, or other things to keep us entertained or to make our lives easier. There is more and more of a decline in even young adults/kids going outside and playing and just being kids due to technology doing everything for them."
ACVJ6IUO9QM4R	essay2	I believe this also to be true. In order to study society, one must study it's major cities because the majority of a society tends to live in a major city. If one were to only study the rural areas or urban areas- one would not get a true feel as to what a society was actually like, or what it had to offer. Studying a city- with it's culture, different cuisines, art, art performances, and a wide range of people will give one a better idea as to what a society really has to offer.  If one were to look at a small town in Florida, such as Ocala rather than a major city such as Miami- one would think that we are a society of red necks and preferred a small-town, farm-life type of existance and would think this was all that we had to offer. however studying Miami you would see that this is clearly not the case at all. One would see that Miami is a vibrant, bustling metropolis filled with a variety of people form different cultures, offered lots of different careers to people, and offered a variety of art, performances, traditions, and activities to do. You can't just take a glimpse at a small part of a society and say that this is how that society is. It is best to look at the whole and determine how it is. Studying a major city offers this.
ACVJ6IUO9QM4R	essay3	Scandals are not useful because they distract us from the more important things that go on in the world. Things like a shooting take away from issues that are really happening right under our noses! The Parkland incident for example, made it so easy for Trump to appoint nothing but his own conservatives for higher up positions and no one even noticed at all. he also passed several laws as well that no one discussed at all because they were too busy dealing with the shooting issue.   you have to always ask yourself what is actually going on here? Those scandals are almost always filled with misinformation because they are actually MEANT to distract us from reality.
AD21ES5UMD77U	essay1	It is not too hard to immagine the not too distant future where man has lost much of his ability to think and act for himself.  Much of once was science fiction has come true with wrist watch cameras and phones that once seemed unrealistic.  AI these days is the new horizon of what's coming.  Smart devices controll our actions, do our shopping, monitor our exercise and even use the breaks on our cars when we are slow to see a collision coming.  It is not a large step past that where those who never had to use their own talents to drive etic will loose the ability to make basic decisions that have been turned over to AI machines and robots for efficency.  A brave new world might just be a place where individualistic thought is outlawed and old fashioned.
AD21ES5UMD77U	essay2	The architecture of ancient cities show us how advanced their civilzations were and what we still use from those cities today.  Aquaducts and sewers are as old as ancient Rome.  Other cities such as Venice and other sea towns show us how we can still relate to our water resources for travel and connection.  Our current sky scrapers are modern version of pueblo citeis in the soutwest and show how some things never change such as the need to maximize the use of space.  Roads through cities are also a great indicator of a citie's connection to surrounding cultures.  Multicultural centers are the most interesting to study and are some of the oldest cities on earth such as Beijing, Moscow, Paris and London.
AD21ES5UMD77U	essay3	"The lazer focus that a scandal brings is almost second nature to humanity.  Learning from the downfall of a famous or infamous person is much easier to absorb for some reason if it involves your avoiding the same disgrace that befell the celebrety.  We all have heard someone say, ""...you don't want a mug shot like Nick Nolte!""  A thousand warnings would be wasted before I would listen to behave but I knew I did not want my friends seeing my picture in the paper like his or other celeb.  Scandals are a good learning tool as to what not to do and everyone pays attention no matter how hard they try not to."
ADKYGTRR8ZLBG	essay1	I think that, on the one hand, it is true, since technology helps us with day-to-day tasks and simplifies many jobs that we had to do before thinking and acting. Now on the other hand technology invites us to use these tools to create to innovate and break paradigms. Having said that, I can conclude that although technology creates shortcuts in which we stop thinking or doing actions, we can definitely say that it can reduce our skills in the future.
ADKYGTRR8ZLBG	essay2	I think that if it is related to studying the big cities to understand the most important characteristics of society but I do not think it is the most important characteristic, I think it is more important to study society's history as they behaved as they have evolved in this way we can learn more .
ADKYGTRR8ZLBG	essay3	The scandals in history have always served as a smoke bomb for the real problems of a country, the scandals are magnets of attention even for celebrities a scandal always ends up being positive for their career as it makes them more famous in one way or another So I think definitely if nobody impacts more than a scandal.
ADSRZGDF54DQ1	essay1	I think that technology can really help the human brain develop beyond our original thoughts. Many people use technology to expand their intellectual abilities. If anything technology has allowed us to expand our Horizons and obtain more knowledge faster than we ever have before. Many people use technology in their workplace and their personal lives and to help stay connected to people around the world. This connection to others around the world and exposure to many different ideas also helps us to expand our original knowledge base. Children are learning at a much faster rate than ever before because of the access of technology for them. Many people with disabilities have been able to use technology as well to engage in careers that they never would have thought before. Voice recognition is a great example of how technology can help someone with a disability communicate with the rest of the world and share their ideas and insights. Technology can be used in amazing ways to help our communities grow and to be more self-sustaining rather than limiting. Technology of course has its downfalls where people do forget simple things such as phone numbers and they do not have to remember their appointments they have a computer to do it for them. However those tasks originally took up space and thinking power that now is freed up to expand to more in-depth processing. People no longer have to waste their mental energy on superfluous information.
ADSRZGDF54DQ1	essay2	I think that understanding some of the major cities it does help to understand the people and how they have developed. However some of the larger cities that are more well-known do not really hold the true history or the true culture within an area. Most of the larger cities have moved beyond the original culture and have moved more into more modern. To really understand another people you should look into the smaller cities where they have more Elder who can tell you the true history of that place.
ADSRZGDF54DQ1	essay3	Scandals do bring certain topics to light and give it attention where otherwise it would have been ignored or brushed under the rug. However scandals can also make people create more out of a topic than is necessary and some people do not realize that the information they're getting is actually people's opinions rather than fact. This is a prime example of what happens when celebrities get arrested or get charged with something. Their story becomes top news and everyone speculates and focuses on what happened and how it could have happened rather than what the facts are and it is common that their cases are actually thrown out because they cannot have an impartial jury. people are more interested in excitement and drama rather than facts.
ADZHJZ078THWQ	essay1	Humans will never be able to stop thinking. Although our reliance on technology can increase, it is human nature to think and wonder about things. We are a very curious animal and our social structure is incredibly important to us. Both of these things involve a thought process. Not only that, but humans have a natural tendency to create and build new tools and innovations. So, even though new technology constantly makes life easier, we will continue to create and engage with one another, because that is what we do. There will always be a new problem to solve or a new innovation to create. There will always be a reason to talk to someone else and develop relationships. In other words, thought is quintessential to human survival.
ADZHJZ078THWQ	essay2	Major cities are a very close relation to the society they are in. Major cities hold the most diverse population in the area, as well as house many of the more popular stores, religions, and innovations. Because of this, when researching a major city, it gives a broader idea of what makes up a civilization. This applies to both past societies and modern societies. Large cities more equally represent the trade intricacies and types of people living in an area. It also shows what part of society is the most important group or what status they hold. It also shows what is considered a symbol of this status.
ADZHJZ078THWQ	essay3	Scandals tend to be covered extensively in the media, when they happen, they are on every piece of news literature. Because of this, they are often more well known and researched than other situations. They are given more coverage and knowledge. Less people are likely to take the time to look up a speaker on an issue. Sometimes it is hard to accept a reality until it is thrown in your face, which a scandal tends to do. A speaker can tell you that something happens, but it is entirely different to see it yourself. This is why scandals are so attention-grabbing, because they seem to call upon a part of society that was always there, but no one would accept it.
AE1YA7Q3UKPRI	essay1	I completely agree with people relying on technology and then the way they think will deteriorate.  An example of this would be my cousin in high school who can't do simple math. When we were playing Monopoly, she couldn't figure out the change from buying properties without her phone.  Also I use my GPS for directions.  When I try to get around without my GPS a lot of times, I am at a complete loss.  I never learned how to read a map.
AE1YA7Q3UKPRI	essay2	I disagree with this statement.  If one only studies the major cities of a society then they will only be looking at a certain set of demographics.  They will not be looking at people who are in the country or suburbs.  Also some states may not really have a major city, people may be more spread out. People that live in a major city have different characteristics than people who don't. Some cities, the people make more money because of the cost of living there. Some people can't live in cities because being around people just freaks them out too much.  They love the wide open spaces.
AE1YA7Q3UKPRI	essay3	"I do agree with this for the most part.  When there is a scandal, like the current sexual harassment by famous men on women.  A whole movement has started with this. People are coming out and saying ""me too"" in hoards.  It is like because of this scandal, people are able to voice what happened to them.  Sometimes as a woman it can be embarrassing to admit that something happened to you.  It just helps that there are other people willing to say they have been there."
AEOFJWOEXF94U	essay1	i will say that I agree the way that people are over reliant on phones and the internet will spell doom for humans and their ability to think for them selves and if the internet ever goes out it might be a national crisis on a large scale
AEOFJWOEXF94U	essay2	i would agree looking at the large cities you can have a look at the hive mind mentality that humans live off of and you will see how they will push back against any thing that is different

AEWPAZBYA7XE	essay1	"It has already become apparent that the use of technology is affecting humans' ability to think for themselves. People rely on social media platforms in a large part for their news. This has started the group think mentality, and has severely inhibited some people's ability to come up with the formation of their own ideas. Another example (albeit a microcosm) is childrens' inability to read analogue clocks. In the UK institutions of learning have adopted digital clocks in the classroom, instead of doing what they should--teach children to read clocks. As we adopt more technologies to make things ""easier"" on ourselves, we are actually robbing ou"
AEWPAZBYA7XE	essay2	To say that the characteristics of a society can be embodied in the study of our urban populations is absurd. The values and ideals of rural populations vary widely from folks found in cities. Most of the support for Donald Trump came mostly from those in rural areas, while the urban populations voted mostly for Clinton. Rural populations tend to be much more concervative that those found in metropolitan areas. I would say this is due in a greater part to citizens in urban populations being much more dependent upon the government. There are great discrepancies between the values of ubanites
AEWPAZBYA7XE	essay3	The Me Too Movement would seem to give credence to this proposition. Once the flood gates were open, people from all over, from all walks of life seem to come out of the woodwork to say that they had in some way been accosted. However, it is my belief that far more have given false testament in this regard. Yes, sexual harrasment exists, but in the number that have presently come to light? I would be much more of the opinion that a great number of these reports have been falsified by people trying to claim their 15 minutes of fame. Scandals may bring some wrong doing to light, but can do more harm that good.
AEX9MA72M10DC	essay1	I think this is already happening. Years ago when we didn't have phones to plan events, calculate things, remember numbers etc- we had to really use our memories and put more thought and effort in too everything. We do however generally do more multi tasking now which leaves us more frazzled and exhausted. While it is good in some ways, it is also very bad for us in the ways that it takes away from our memory and from other humans around us.
AEX9MA72M10DC	essay2	" I am not sure this is very true. As people who live in the country can be quiet different from those who live in the city in my experience. I think you can know what city people can be like, and definitely ""ghettos"" and rich people. However, to know a society, you must know all parts not just one facet. People who live in cities can tend to be quite different than other types. I live in a major city and I am not happy here, nor like typical ""city"" people."
AEX9MA72M10DC	essay3	 I don't quite know if I am for or against this. Of course scandal or issues can help us see what major issues are happening behind the scenes. However these have happened since the dawn of time. No laws are going to stop people from doing bad things if they really want to do them. We don't need more reform or more laws. We need better people in positions of power that have good moral fiber. Scandals fear monger too much and make people want to create more laws, which can be both good and bad.
AEXF5EUX32U0M	essay1	I believe that people rely too much on technology to solve their problems.  It use to be that if you did not know the answer to something you would have to put in the work to find the answer.  Now all you have to do is type into Google what you want to know and within seconds there is the answer.  With a cell phone who has any reason to think about math either.  You now have a calculator at your disposal at all times.  Need to figure out a tip? there is an app for that.  Even driving is requiring less and less thinking.  Now there are cars that can drive themselves so no worrying about having to pay attention to where you are going before too long.  Yes technology is a great thing but what is the true cost?
AEXF5EUX32U0M	essay2	It is impossible to see society as a whole in smaller cities.  When you visit larger cities you are able to see all of the different cultures all mingling together and working together as one.  You are able to see the ways that this works as well as the ways that the people from different backgrounds clash.  These benefits and disadvantages are what make society what it truly is.  When you visit a small town many of the people seem to form a group mentality.  It is really not possible for a larger city to do this not only because of size but also because of true diversity. With a large city there is not only religious and cultural diversity but also income diversity which is a very important part of society.
AEXF5EUX32U0M	essay3	When there is a scandal in just about anything it seems to bring everything to the surface, the good, the bad and the ugly.  Take for example the Bill Cosby issue that was in the news for the last few years.  Before that first woman came forward everyone thought all was good.  After that first woman they seemed to come in with reports in a flood.  Had that scandal never came to light there is a good chance that no one would have ever known.  Anyone can say just about anything about anything or anyone but that is all it is, words.  A scandal puts the person or business under the public eye and makes everyone stand up and pay attention.
AGRKG3YT3KMD8	essay1	Technology is a tool, and can be used for both productive and unproductive ends. A common example cited is that of the calculator - if people can use a calculator to add and subtract, how will they know how to do it by hand? Blindly using a calculator is probably not a good thing, but it also allows much greater possibilities for those who truly understand math. A person who knows math can do so much more with it than one who does not. It is for this reason that technology itself is not to blame for people's inability to learn, or think for themselves. It is the inability, or unwillingness, to learn that is the problem.
AGRKG3YT3KMD8	essay2	The major cities of a country are likely large because they are important centers of commerce, science, education and arts. For this reason a student of a society should study them very closely. However, the provincial areas of a country are equally important, because they provide farmland and people from rural areas who converge into the cities. A city will not be able to survive without rural areas supporting it. Also, cities tend to cluster certain types of moral values and perspectives that may not be representative of the country as a whole. People who live outside of cities often have a vastly different outlook on life, due to their differing priorities. Thus it is important to neglect neither city nor province in one's studies.
AGRKG3YT3KMD8	essay3	Scandals are very illuminating, and can highlight aspects of a person or organization's character that highly polished eulogies often omit. However, they also direct focus away from more general societal problems which may have caused the scandal to occur. For instance, leaking oil in a refinery became a large scandal for fossil fuel giant BP, causing much of the focus to center on BP and not the wider problems of corruption within government and major media organs turning a blind eye to corporate malfeasance. Specific targeting of BP also allowed the incident to align on partisan lines, with comical defenses and apologies on the side of the Republican Party and lies of omission by the Democrats who conveniently omitted the malfeasance of their own corporate donors.
AGU1FHY3JHXSF	essay1	With people relying on technology to solve all of their problems they become dependent on the technology instead of their own ability to solve issues. It has become so common to use calculators that some people don't have the ability to do math in their head or even on a piece of paper for that matter.  It is making them mentally lazy when they don't have to do any of the research themselves.  Instead of doing research people just google what they need to know.  People need to read more and spend less time relying on technology.
AGU1FHY3JHXSF	essay2	When someone studies the major cities they can get a good idea of what kind of people that society has in it.  In major cities many people that live there have the same characteristics.  It is good to see how people interact within that city to decide what kind of society they live in.  The major cities have the biggest population per area than in towns or villages.  When studying the major cities for society characteristics one must remember that only applies for that city.  Things are much different in smaller towns than in major cities.
AGU1FHY3JHXSF	essay3	Scandals are not all that useful because when a scandal happens it usually just divides the people that are involved.  If it is a scandal that is political for instance the different parties then begin to argue and fight which then divides more than they were.  There have been some problems that have been resolved because a scandal was brought to lite but that is far and few between.  Rather than looking for a scandal to fix a problem we as a society should look for the problem to fix first before it becomes a scandal.  There wouldn't be as many tabloids if their were no more scandals being brought to the light.
AH31QLJ57XC8W	essay1	I am particularly agreeing with this, but also find fault. We as a society are becoming to depending on IT software and devices to do everything for us. Its like we dont want to think anymore, and thats what these companys want. They want us to just blindly fall in line. That will stop us from making choices for our selves, rather make them for the benefits of those companys to make them richer. But with that change in the world also comes the ones who will stand up,think for themsleves and fight back. Time will truly teal of strong we can be as a country all together. For right now, we seem to be loosing that battle . With everyday comes a new App or new devices that promotes problem solving so we dont have to do it for outselves, and we keep falling for it.
AH31QLJ57XC8W	essay2	I believe this to be a true fact about understanding societies all over the world. Big cities are the places where you find all kind of different people and situations make make you grow into a better person. Its like cities are the tasting grounds for any kind of device, software, or just different way of life to live you arent familiar with.  When these different valuables are introduced, people change the way they interact. Now that could be for the good or for the worst. Either way we have to see how it effects people in these cities, and that results can help you will a clear understanding on how people interact with each other around the world.
AH31QLJ57XC8W	essay3	I agree fully with this findings and say it ads to the better understanding of people and companys that are involved. There are alot of people who try to distract us and make of false truths about whatever they are selling to us to make a profit. We must know the full truth to be on board with anything. So if there is a scandal breaking, it is out right to now so then we can move in the direction we are comfortable with. Even more so when people and companys are breaking the law, we must now. It is for the betterment of the world to stop Evil from taking over the good of the people. These scandals help us focus on seeing right from wrong with facts and truths instead of just tlaking about it.
AIICJA0A5J8NF	essay1	I believe that technology really is hindering the ability of people to think for themselves. When someone has a question nowadays, they google it and search for the answer instead of doing physical research. We set timers and reminders on phones just to remember the simplest things. We are using devices in the home to control appliances and set them on automatic. That just means it is one less thing for people to do on their own and to think of on their own. People have gotten to where they can't do anything without their phones. They can't remember simple phone numbers or memos unless it is saved to their phone. If you have a math problem, just put it in the calculator. If you misspell a word, just to spellcheck.
AIICJA0A5J8NF	essay2	I think that cities are places where all different types of people gather. You'll find everyone from high class to low class people here. If the society is open to people different from themselves, it will be seen in a city by everyone getting long. There will be less crime in a society if this were the case. In towns and smaller cities, there are less people, so there is less representation of the society as whole. Whereas in the city, there are so many different cultures and races with all sorts of beliefs, so there is a better representation of how the society is.
AIICJA0A5J8NF	essay3	"I mainly disagree with this. Problems come to light every day, but when it is a true scandal, that is all anyone talks about. It is no longer possible for other issues to be solved because of this ""scandal"" that is suddenly so important. Scandals aren't always an important issue that needs to be solved. Sometimes, a scandal is really just someone's decision that other people don't agree with. It is then blown out of proportion. A celebrity being and acting like a normal person can be called a scandal. Issues that need to be fixed can be solved just as well if not better by someone who has noticed the problem and decides to speak up on its behalf instead of a news source who want ratings"
AIZTLQM7HHQN6	essay1	I believe this is a true statement as our brains are designed to adapt and solve problems. Consider this, before the age of the Internet we, as human beings, had to live within the knowledge that we knew. That is we were concerned with the knowledge provided to us by our community, area, society contacts, and family. If we did not know the answer to a question we had to ask, infer, or go to the library and comb over books to try and find an answer. In this age, we simply pull out our smartphones or go on our computer and 'Google' the concept we wish to know. This has great power in expanding our field knowledge, but has the side effect of causing us to not critically think or infer, but simply to look it up. Over time this will cause our critical thinking and reasoning skills to deteriorate as we rely upon instant gratification in what we want or desire. Why think about something when you can look it up?
AIZTLQM7HHQN6	essay2	This is partly true because societies are based off of cities and cities are based off of communities. The connections are not always clear, but consider this. In order for a city to grow two things must happen - a suitable area must be found and multiple people must settle within the zone. As it grows and expands it evolves from a community, to a district, town,  to a city in of itself. You could say that a city is simply a reflection of the society that resides within it. You can look at this in detail by studying different aspects of the city such as its architecture, funding, cleanliness, transportation network, and even the attitudes of the people within it. For example, are they nice, smart, funny, rude, in a rush, easy-going, etc. In this way studying a city gives a unique perspective of the society contained within it, but it does not necessarily follow that it applies to every other city. In fact, it's often a point of interest to visit different cities because of the vast amounts of different culture, structures, and atmosphere.
AIZTLQM7HHQN6	essay3	This is true in some respects as it could be said that the problem was never considered a problem until that time. Or, it was simply overlooked because it had never been done before and was considered unlikely enough to even consider oversight. What scandals do is focus our attention on lesser known or lesser considered aspects of society. One could argue this with a few example such as Bill Clinton's blow job scandal in the Oval Office or Watergate. Scandals, by nature, work as a catalyst. That is, they incite deep feelings that blow up and catch on in a viral way. It's similar to 'celebrity scandals'. One such example is the Kardashian Photoshop trend or even as broad as the unrealistic model images in magazines that make girls feel flawed or imperfect. This is a slightly different concept, but it works in the same way by creating these debatable rush of feelings whether they be moral or otherwise.
AJ4WQY338BIMN	essay1	The statement linking technology negatively with free thinking plays on recent human experience over the past century. Surely there has been no time in history where the lived lives of people have changed more dramatically. A quick reflection on a typical day reveals how technology has revolutionized the world. Most people commute to work in an automobile that runs on an internal combustion engine. During the workday, chances are high that the employee will interact with a computer that processes information on silicon bridges that are .09 microns wide. Upon leaving home, family members will be reached through wireless networks that utilize satellites orbiting the earth. Each of these common occurrences could have been inconceivable at the turn of the 19th century.  The statement attempts to bridge these dramatic changes to a reduction in the ability for humans to think for themselves. The assumption is that an increased reliance on technology negates the need for people to think creatively to solve previous quandaries. Looking back at the introduction, one could argue that without a car, computer, or mobile phone, the hypothetical worker would need to find alternate methods of transport, information processing and communication. Technology short circuits this thinking by making the problems obsolete.
AJ4WQY338BIMN	essay2	In today's Contemporary and fast paced world, each country's major cities play a very important role in  deciding the economic, social as well as political status of a country. The major cities reflect upon the  overall development and provide a bird's view of that country. However, this is an unfair generalization  made by the author that looking into the major cities will give us all the important characteristics of a  society. Let’s further look into this.  For decades, a country has been divided into two fragments. Firstly, the major cities where  Urbanization and development have taken at a faster pace. Secondly the towns and rural areas of the  country which provide a closer look into the cultural heritage. The major cities have helped in establishing international standards and maintaining the foreign relations. Every major city of any country will always have the best amenities and  and facilities be it New Delhi in India, Paris in France or Beijing in China. However these cities may provide some insight into the culture and traditions of that country ,their socioeconomic status and the way their society functions but will not give a holistic picture. Due to Commercialization and the growing needs of each city to compete with each other in the race of being the best, they somewhat are not capable of capturing the true essence of their society and the bucolic beauty of that nation.
AJ4WQY338BIMN	essay3	To begin with, I agree that under some circumstances scandals can focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could. Scandals sometimes make people curious, and encourage the public to look for the whole story of an issue. Scandals can also raise pressure on governments, and force them to address certain problems. In addition, scandals can direct public’s attention to issues that some people are trying to dissemble or unwilling to reveal. For instance, especially in a society ruled by autocracy, or where the public does not have the right to speak freely, scandals can direct public’s attention on problems that people are not allowed to discuss in public, and when it is risky for any speaker to speak in public. It is possible that scandals can place pressure on the government, and then the issue can be addressed in order to placate the public. In this case, scandals are useful since it directs public’s attention on problems that no speaker or reformer ever could.  However, this is not always the case. In domestic countries such as the US, where people have the right to speak freely, it is possible that some speakers or reformers can focus our attention on problems in ways that scandals can. For instance, Martin Luther King succeeded in focusing the public’s attention on the issue of segregation, and unequal right for black people. He gave speeches in public, and advocated people to protest against segregation. Finally, he successfully directed people’s attention on segregation, and forced that country to amend the unjustifiable laws. Therefore, I think it is possible that some outstanding reformers and speaker can focus people’s attention in a society where people have right to speak.  In addition, even although scandals may focus public’s attention on some problems, it is not always useful. Sometimes, scandals tend to focus on some trivial or unrelated issues about celebrities in ways that can mislead the public. For instance, we have heard many sexual scandals about many politicians, in some cases, these politicians may be competent in public office and good leaders, but people may start to distrust them or deny their abilities because of their misbehaviors in their personal life. In addition, we may hear some scandals like some politicians are alcoholic or rude to their friends, and these scandals can tarnish their images, and exaggerate the problems, which can possibly mislead the public, and ignore their contributions and talents. In this case, scandals are not always useful
AJNQ2PBD07FKE	essay1	"I absolutely believe this to be true. Take the use of calculators for instance, they are not new, but they certainly replace the need for people to know math as well as they should. Another example is ""auto correct"", a lot of people don't know the correct way to spell certain words. I already see grammatical errors every day online, such as people not knowing the difference between - their, there, and they're or your and you're. I believe people are becoming more and more impatient and lazy by wanting things done quickly even while sacrificing quality."
AJNQ2PBD07FKE	essay2	"I think this is slightly wrong, when you think of people traveling abroad or to a destination they go to the ""popular"" tourist cities like Cancun, Paris, Orlando, New York City, etc. These cities are great and yes they have lots to see but do they really exhibit the culture of the whole country. When you go Cancun you hear a majority speaking English and not Spanish in order to uphold hospitality standards to tourists. When you go Paris again they speak English instead of French to uphold hospitality standards to tourists. I think if people want to really understand and enjoy important characteristics and cultures of a place they need to take a path less traveled, see where the people really live and what they really do or eat. I went to Dominican Republic when young and my parents signed us up for a tour, we got to see where the people lived and what they did for a living and the real poor part of the country. It was truly eye opening."
AJNQ2PBD07FKE	essay3	Scandals make people curious and they encourage the public to look for more information on the issue. Scandals can occasionally raise pressure on governments and force them to address certain problems. For other countries not as blessed as the United States in a society ruled by autocracy or where the public does not have the right to speak freely, scandals can direct attention on problems that people are not allowed to discuss in public and make it risky for any speaker to speak in public. Scandals sometimes can catch public’s attention and shed light on some issues that may be controversial and worth attention, however it is possible that some speakers and reformers can focus public’s attention in a useful way. I think free speech is important though and facts need told.
AJRY9ALX8069Y	essay1	I agree with this statement because, over the years, as technology has become more advanced, people have become lazier. People don't do things on their own as much without relying on computers. People use calculators more and not their brains to solve simple math problems. People don't have as much critical thinking ability. People don't even write their own essays anymore; they just go online and copy and past things from different articles or buy essays online. People just rely on computers and their algorithms to solve problems nowadays. People aren't as innovative and creative anymore, either. As long as someone or something else can do it for them, people will rely on that and be lazy. It's just an innate part of human beings that can't be changed.
AJRY9ALX8069Y	essay2	Major cities are thriving metropolises. They are major hubs of civilization. This is why I think we should study these major cities. They are major cities because they are thriving and have been successful. They show all the accomplishments of humanity in them (businesses, transportation, landscaping, architecture, etc), more-so than other places that humans inhabit. Also, major political issues and businesses also occupy these cities, so it is important to learn from them. There are many events and protests, for example, going on in these cities, which give a person an inside look at what is important to humanity. Major cities usually have the most people, too, and the most diversity. You can learn a lot of things about human society and culture by studying them. For example, by studying San Francisco, you can learn a lot about various liberal issues (such as gay rights) because it is a very liberal city.
AJRY9ALX8069Y	essay3	People love scandals. It's just part of human nature. We as human beings love to hear about other people and their problems. We love juicy stories and gossip about people that matter to us. That's why it's useful to focus our attention on scandals because they present important issues in society. They turn our attention to important people and issues that we normally would just brush aside and not care about. Anything that involves conflict intrigues and delights people and negative issues will always get more attention than positive ones. Therefore, I think scandals are extremely important to getting the attention of people about politicians, celebrities, and other societal influencers.
AJTKU0XJ7QTME	essay1	I disagree that reliance on technology will lead to a deterioration of the ability of humans to think for themselves.  In fact, I believe quite the opposite.  Technology serves as a tool to provide answers and assistance for tasks that humans are already capable of completing.  Never before has humankind had such a vast amount of knowledge available at the fingertips of even the poorest among us.  People are learning to consider various sources and not always believe what they are provided.  Having technology performing physical tasks also allows more people to take the time to think about and problem solve themselves since they no longer have to waste time on the more trivial tasks.
AJTKU0XJ7QTME	essay2	Studying major cities will indeed provide a great deal of understanding of many of the characteristics of human society.  Major cities typically have the most diversity, culture, and opportunities.  However it leaves out important aspects that are not able to be found outside of more rural areas.  Farming, for example, is one of the most important things in our society but it can not be seen in a major city.  On top of that, rural living is a culture in itself that is vastly different from city living.  Even living in a smaller metropolis can be a world away from living in a major city and show an entirely different way of life.
AJTKU0XJ7QTME	essay3	Scandals have many good an bad aspects.  Oftentimes scandals make society finally confront problems that we know exist but are not able to speak about for fear of making enemies.  As seen recently with the Harvey Weinstein controversy, much good and change can be brought about by scandals.  Scandals unfortunately can also be used as a smokescreen.  While our attention is on one issue that has reached a flashpoint, policymakers are able to introduce and enact rules that otherwise would raise red flags among the general public.
AKLG79EPGKTDP	essay1	Artificial intelligence is at an all-time high. There's no consideration put into asking Siri for directions to the store, or telling Alexa to play your favorite song. We, as people, are beginning to use technology as a crutch that can only become worse from here on out as there's more advancements in the future. Though as useful as technology can be, it weakens the mind, weakens the ability to make critical decisions, weakens our thought process as we shorten our attention spans and leave the thinking to something artificial. Just as children that have been sheltered and pampered all their lives by their parents, we will become increasingly dependent on technology to do things for us - out of convenience, for sake of saving time, etc. and such habits will cause for concern in other areas such as worsening of physical and mental health, and lacking in communicative skills. There's no need to remember someone's phone number anymore when it's all conveniently at your fingertips. There's no need for comprehension when passages can be summarized in seconds and without thought.
AKLG79EPGKTDP	essay2	Characteristics of a society should not solely be sought in major cities. One must look at the whole picture and not merely its parts in order to understand how people act, how a society functions; a society cannot function merely only by a majority, but the minority must also be considered in order to be optimally seen. Blind-sighting leaves plenty of room for error where characteristics not otherwise emphasized in a major city can be found. Also, a major population does not automatically equate to everyone acting or behaving the same way. A congregation of hundreds of thousands and even millions of people are all made up of complicated, individual characteristics that need to be included in understanding. Generic stereotyping is a result of making a basic opinion about many people without considering the rest of the people - and this holds true for society as well.
AKLG79EPGKTDP	essay3	Scandals exist because we do not balance and consider what-ifs of various scenarios. Scandals are twisted to be shocking and outrageous so as to appeal to us and garner our attention in a radically different way than how a speaker would maintain its audience. It should be noted that not everyone's attention will be grabbed at the sight or hearing of a scandal - as every individual is unique and what they focus on is not all mutually the same thing. Some find celebrity scandals enticing and people like living vicariously through risky actors and singers; others are put off and immediately turn away from such situations because it is not the kind of information that is attention-grabbing. A situation does not necessarily have to be shocking in order to gain attention from people - as what's interesting to one person is not necessarily the same case for another.
AKNYT1NTK2UFK	essay1	"Technology, especially cell phones, while putting a ton of information at our fingertips, is ultimately making people think less for themselves. Smart phones basically act as a tiny personal assistant that keeps track of things like phone numbers, schedules and work documents all at the touch of the screen or saying a simple ""Hey Google"". Before, people needed to remember things or organize them accordingly, generally making people have to use their head more. Now we are automatically alerted. Things will only continue down this track as more artificial intelligence is created."
AKNYT1NTK2UFK	essay2	I agree that in order to understand a society, it is important to study and experience its major cities. These cities are key to interacting with the locals, seeing the architecture and literally having a taste of the cuisine. All of these things are what create a society, a culture. Most major cities that you visit will leave you with a lasting vibe and an impression of what it's like. While many have a very strong heritage, like Paris, there are many places that have more subtle distinctions that make then unique.
AKNYT1NTK2UFK	essay3	Scandals are a waste of energy and news headlines. More often than not the only thing they do is distract from what the real issues are or what is happening in the background. The Trump administration is a shining example of this: on a daily basis they use bait and switch news techniques to promote their agenda in secret while keeping people confused and chasing silly scandals. With so much contradicting news stories floating around it's impossible to keep it all straight and still have the attention span for real issues. Scandals like this are classic examples of gaslighting the general public. Scandals are not a practical or fair way of manipulating the issues.
AKZ8SFOAI4RZN	essay1	Use of technology will not cause people's ability to think for themselves to deteriorate. I would argue that it would do the opposite. Technology will help us to spend less time on menial task. Instead it will allow people to focus on and address more complex problems. As an example, an engineer can use a calculator to quickly solve a mathematical problem that would have otherwise taken him several minutes to do. In freeing up his time, he can now focus on the bigger and more complex areas of his job.
AKZ8SFOAI4RZN	essay2	To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one shouldn't just study the major cities. The major cities are often the exception. The suburbs are where the bulk of the people live and that is where the society's life style is most easily observed. Rural areas are also important to take into consideration. A society is the sum of its parts and taking a look at only one aspect will cause a person to misleading conclusions about a society.
AKZ8SFOAI4RZN	essay3	Scandals are not useful. They generally focus on the superficial aspects of an issue and do not help to address the root or underlying problem. Scandals distract from the real problem. They give the illusion that a problem is not endemic and people focus on one particular instance of it happening. For instance many company scandals are not unique to that company. When that company goes under, or takes the brunt of the back lash, people ignore that it occurs else where in other companies.
AL83KKXUORS9Y	essay1	Technology has definately had an impact on the ability of humans to think for themselves.  As more and more items become computerized, the ability to critically think through problems has diminished.  One way that comes to mind is the ability to solve simple math problems without using a computer has become harder.  The less we practice tasks using our only our mind, the slower we become in solving problems.  This is one case where practice makes perfect and the less we practice our critical thinking skills, the less perfect we become.  We do have to use our mind to make the various types of technology work to do the things we want, however I think that we are losing lots of ability to think for ourselves.
AL83KKXUORS9Y	essay2	Major cities hold important clues to the important characteristics of a society.  How well a city solves the various problems it's citizens face in everyday life is an important indicator of how well society is functioning.  A disfunctional city has lots of crime and homelessness.  Not having enough well paying jobs has a negative effect on the stability of society.  Poverty and lack of affordable housing show weakness in our society.  The gap between the well to do and the poor has never been larger as evidenced by the state of many of our major cities.
AL83KKXUORS9Y	essay3	I do not agree that scandals are useful in focusing our attention on problems.  Scandals offer no real or reliable information that is useful.  The only thing that scandals offer is to divide and distract us from the real problems at hand.  We should focus on the facts to help us solve our problems.  Honest and reliable information is much more helpful in making decisions about how best to work on the best solutions.  I personally do not think that scandals serve any purpose in helping us solve our problems and in many cases scandals may actually cause more problems.  A positive attitude will do much more to instill a sense of trust and the make us want to work together to solve problems.
AL8KOIH1DJ7D9	essay1	The rise of technology and automation is definitely causing a shift in the way people think about and approach everyday problems and issues. For the sake of convenience, people are often kept on a need-to-know basis about the inner workings of things like cell phones and computers that facilitate our daily lives. Rather than having to truly understand specific concepts and why they work, we simply need to know which programs to run, which apps to download, or which sites to visit. Similar to how kids are taught to do math without calculators first, in order to understand the underlying procedures and ideas, I think people should take time to learn how and why things work, rather than just accepting that they don't need to learn at all, because a computer can do all the thinking for them. If we don't have to drive our own cars, cook our own meals, solve our own problems, or articulate our own ideas, what will we even be good for?
AL8KOIH1DJ7D9	essay2	Major cities are interesting in the study of certain aspects of social psychology, but are not the only facet of society we should be studying. Considering the bulk of Americans, in particular, live in rural areas, it might be to their detriment if we only choose to study how humanity functions in close quarters. Not everybody wants to live in a major city. In addition, different cities have different histories, and different cultures and subcultures within them; you could spend a lifetime studying New York, but that wouldn't tell you very much about San Francisco, for example. Understanding important characteristics of a society means studying all aspects of it, and urban areas are just one of many facets of culture. Behavior in people tends to be drastically different when they are stacked on top of each other in high rises, as opposed to when they live spread out, surrounded by wilderness. Large cities seem to be removing us from our roots in nature, and I believe nature is an important area of study, as it is the source of life itself.
AL8KOIH1DJ7D9	essay3	Scandals can generate interest in certain subjects that might not have been generated otherwise. They can, however, be a major distraction, as well as a diversionary tactic. For instance, a political candidate can draw attention toward a scandal involving his or her opponent, in order to make the public overlook the candidate's own flaws and controversial beliefs. Scandal can give people something to talk about, but it is debatable whether or not it is anything of actual importance, or if it is just juicy gossip to keep peoples' minds occupied. Scandal is good for television ratings, with the bottom line being generating revenue for media conglomerates. It can be used to divide people, making them take sides against each other, rather than focusing on a bigger picture of community and togetherness. Does bringing a scandal to the attention of the public even yield positive results most of the time? Myriad scandals surround the Trump administration, and all it has really done is divide our country and get more people consuming the political agendas associated with conglomerates like Sinclair. Scandal is just the new form of reality television.
ALCOP0S6PFR2O	essay1	While it is true that the more primitive problems humans will no longer have to solve, there will be new problems to solve in the future. These problems will be less related to starting a fire and more related to debugging a program, troubleshooting a piece of equipment, and other more technological problems. The problems aren't becoming less, they're simply moving to a different subject. Knowing how to start a fire or grow your own crops may not be particularly useful in the distant future, unless there is an apocalypse or other world-ending scenario. Humans ability to think for themselves will always be an important trait, and one that evolution will always select for. We just find other things to think about, and other problems to solve. There is nothing wrong with technology solving our simpler problems for us. The human mind is still the most powerful processor on the planet.
ALCOP0S6PFR2O	essay2	This is definitely true to a degree if you don't think about it too much. Surely, if you want to study the most important characteristics of society, you have to look at the largest human societies. However, if you want to know the most important characteristics of societies, you need to look at all different types of societies. You have to look at major cities, small towns, mid-size cities, and even the tiny villages. Each different type of society has their own characteristics. Small towns may have a greater sense of belonging between humans, and more camaraderie. Mid-size cities may have many of the same characteristics of the major cities, while also retaining some of their small town defining characteristics. And major cities are often a conglomerate of many other cultures, grouped into one, each with their own distinct characteristics, beliefs, and values. So while it's important to study major cities, smaller towns can be just as crucial.
ALCOP0S6PFR2O	essay3	Often, we don't even think of a problem until a scandal has revealed it. We may not have ever thought about the specific collusion of  Watergate had it never happened. While scandals are exclusively bad for society in that they breach trust and often create separations between parties and people, it is true that one scandal is often all it takes for the problem to be discussed, resolved, and prevented from happening again in the future. It doesn't make scandals useful, but it's a positive side effect of a negative action, in that generally a specific scandal only happens once. This can change in different societies and cultures, however. There may be Watergates in the political parties of other countries in the future. A country may think that they'll never have to worry about having a specific scandal because they've never had it in the past, even if other countries have. Because of this, they won't properly prepare for the possibility of a scandal happening to them.
ALM8YFO0272UR	essay1	I can see where the point of the issue is coming from, but i must say that i don' agree with it. One could argue that with things like calculators people become less caring when it comes to knowing math equations themselves which i can agree with to an extent but there are plenty of other points to counter that. Look at the recent history of the world and you will see that the point is false. In the last few hundred years our technology has advanced rapidly to what it is know. However, i think it is quite clear  that as a society we have gotten smarter over the same time period. While the skills we learn may change as time changes we still are able to learn more than we used to thanks to the advances in technology. This shows that as long as our teaching methods and skills develop along with technology the point is mute.
ALM8YFO0272UR	essay2	It is my opinion that the issue in this case is correct. Surely you can learn a decent amount of society from other places, but to look at a major city will give you the best look at what society truly is. Looking elsewhere you may see bits and pieces of what we would call society but if you look to a major city you get to see the whole picture at once. Such a conglomerate of people allows us to clearly envision what modern society means to us and to see the lines between both the good and bad sides of society. Being able to  see the whole picture at once makes it a lot easier for us t o define society as opposed to piecing it together from many smaller pieces. It is my belief that these large cities serve as melting pots that truly highlight societal.
ALM8YFO0272UR	essay3	In this case i would have to say that i am in agreement wit the point. In today's world it seems like something has to be scandalous to grab many peoples attention. It is not something i necessarily agree with, but it is the way it is. While a speaker or reformer may be able to get their point across to some people it seems that the masses have no interest in most events unless there is something scandalous behind it. I think as a society we thrive off of others drama so as soon as that becomes a part of whatever is going on a lot more people will tune in to see what s going on. I think to prove this you would simply have to look at news ratings, i am certain that stories that could be called scandalous preform better than ones that are not. Maybee one dday we can move away fro mthis bur for now thats
ALSJ5JQPC3A82	essay1	I both agree and disagree with this statement. I agree that the ability of humans to think in some ways - to retain information, do simple calculations, carry out basic survival skills, etc - does deteriorate as technology takes over more of those aspects for people. But I think technology will also allow people to discover new ways of thinking, and reach higher intellectual levels than previous generations. When skills and knowledge are forgotten, it's usually because they've been replaced with new skills and new knowledge. I may not know how to catch and gut a fish, but I know how to drive to the grocery store and buy a salmon fillet. And a grocery trip is a lot faster than a fishing trip, which frees up my time for other pursuits, intellectual or otherwise.
ALSJ5JQPC3A82	essay2	I agree that it is important to study cities in order to understand many characteristics of society, however I don't think that cities represent the most important characteristics. The majority of people live in cities so the demographics of major cities and the structures contained within them affect the lives and livelihoods of large amounts of 'society'. But there is also a significant population of suburb- and rural-dwelling people, especially in the US. The culture and points of view of rural people often differ significantly from those of city dwellers, and so to get a full picture of a society, it's important to take into consideration different populations, and their similarities and differences.
ALSJ5JQPC3A82	essay3	I mostly agree, but I think it depends on the scandal. Getting media attention and publicising an issue or injustice can be an effective way of achieving positive social change, and scandals are interesting to many people, especially if they contain numerous salacious details. But this kind of media coverage can easily get out of hand, with people focusing on the wrong things. Publicizing scandals also has a tendency to shift the blame from society/the underlying causes to the individuals involved, not engaging in the underlying causes in a critical way. I think the best compromise is to support a strong, independent media with multiple sources and viewpoints.
AM2KK02JXXW48	essay1	Technology is certainly advancing at speeds that are hard to imagine. Every day, we hear about something new. Technology is now solving more and more problems and allowing humans to spend their time thinking about other problems. Will that mean that humans' ability to think for themselves to deteriorate, that's a good question.  I think that it depends on the individual person, whether or not they are doing other things with their lives to help keep their brains smart.  As this issue is posed towards society as a whole, it is likely that as humans get lazier, the more their ability to think for themselves will lessen. Just like most people today are not able to take care of a farm, it's because they never learned it.
AM2KK02JXXW48	essay2	It is necessary to study the major cities of a society in order to understand its most important characteristics.  Not only the cities, but every type of community. Major cities are the most densely populated areas of a society, so that should give a sense as to the most dominant characteristics of that society.  Characteristics of a society need to be judged by how high a percentage of the society behaves that way. Major cities have the most people and the most interactions between people on a daily and yearly basis. Societies have very many various characteristics that are more easily understood by looking at the cities.
AM2KK02JXXW48	essay3	When a scandal hits the news, it most definitely makes people in society at large more aware of it.  It becomes part of the common knowledge of society. When the large portion of a society becomes aware of the scandal, they are better informed of it because of the shock or entertainment values.  If a speaker or reformer simply spoke out about such problems, it would not reach nearly the same size audience. In today's society, things have to be outrageous and scandalous in order for them to leave a mark on the public consciousness. When people can witness these scandals in the news, they can learn from them, but most importantly, when they see the consequences of them, they will much less likely repeat the offenses.
AM8HWCZFGT1O5	essay1	I agree on a certain level. I think a good example is the use of a calculator. While we are relying on the technology to do calculations that we input, we are missing out on the steps inbetween. We may not be as good at arithmetic relying so much on technology, but we are generally able to progress faster and learn things that are more important with these shortcuts.
AM8HWCZFGT1O5	essay2	I disagree. The major cities aren't a good representation of the rest of the area. For example, San Francisco is nothing like Sacramento. The culture, people, and lifestyle are completely different. Even general wealth is very different, including stores and restaurants available. I think to learn the important characteristics of a society, one must learn about the average people in it, what they view, and how they live life.
AM8HWCZFGT1O5	essay3	I don't think scandals are completely useful. The problem is that once a scandal arises, everyone else decides to come out. People become insensitive to the problem hearing it in the news everyday. People then accept it as something that happens a lot, instead of a problem they need to fix. I think a good example of one is the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Once that happened a bunch of other celebrities decided to come out, instead of doing it when it happened. People then started making jokes about it once they found the issue old, though that doesn't account for everyone.
AMDPJ713Z3IJL	essay1	People rely on technology too much. Technology is being used to dumb down society. Some people are unable to read maps or navigate properly because the rely on GPS systems. People are unable to properly look up information due to GOOGLE providing it. People who are illiterate are not motivated to learn to read because they use talk to text technology.
AMDPJ713Z3IJL	essay2	Major cities are a good representation of society. Cities have the largest populations and allow for a large cross section of people to be studied. Cities have the most diverse populations as opposed to rural areas. Cities are usually on the forefront for the newest trends. If rural areas are the only areas that are studied, you will not get a good idea of what society has to offer.
AMDPJ713Z3IJL	essay3	Scandals are useful to bring people's attention to things they might not notice otherwise. Scandals focus on things that are not mainstream. Scandals may appeal to other types of people who might not be interested in conventional news. Scandals can package information in an entertaining way that people might find appealing. Scandals are also able to bring to light things that otherwise might be swept under the rug.
AMNMG3DCCC166	essay1	I completely agree with the statement that the ability to think for yourself will diminish as you rely more on technology to solve issues for you. I see it everyday in children. They do not know an answer to a math problem or how to spell a word and they automatically are going to google or siri. This is a fun way for them. They are given all information that is needed and they are not actually learning. I can remember when I was a kid, my parents would make me write my spelling words 10 times each. I am a great speller. Technology definitely has its advantages , but it sure does have its downfalls. People are becoming dependent on the internet to solve the problems that arise. Unless precautions are in place this problem will become more overwhelming and more dependent
AMNMG3DCCC166	essay2	I do not agree with that to understand the characteristics of society you must study the major cities. The major cities throughout the US has a mixture of every kind of group that there is. I am sure that there are groups of high income. The gates communities that sit on the outskirts of a city that acts like there is not crime and poor people in their neighborhood. There is a middle class and the poor section of town, the people that are from across the tracks. In any major city, these days there are homeless people. They are on street corners trying to collect money. They are camped out wherever they can find. each city has its own crime rate and some cities are higher than others. Everywhere is the same, just a different location. To determine the characteristics, you need to look at the people and how they are and how they act. You will learn characteristics from the people.
AMNMG3DCCC166	essay3	I agree that scandals are useful. For instance, lets take a look at our  president of the United States. He has scandals surrounding him for as long as he has been in office. The latest is the Stormy Daniels. It has been brought to the attention of the USA and alot of people are now seeing what type of man he really is. Has the scandal not made headline news, so many people would still be blind and believe in him and his policies. Our attention has been focused on the issues now that the scandal was brought about. Scandals even though not always the whole truth but always having some truth to it, makes people aware of the problems. The public loves a good scandal also.
AMPMTF5IAAMK8	essay1	I don't agree with this statement.  Humans are remarkable at staying busy and finding new things to do.  I don't believe that will ever stop even as we grow more technological.  The universe is full of mysteries and there will always be many inherent motivations to continue pushing the boundaries.  People will continue to think for  themselves and explore do to a variety of reasons like curiosity or the potential for profit.  I don't believe that humans will ever stop being curious or stop pushing boundaries.  It is very human to be ambitious and this is the primary reason for all of our evolutionary success.
AMPMTF5IAAMK8	essay2	I very much agree with this statement.  Cities are what make humans the civilized creatures that we are.  It was our congregating into cities that began so many other pursuits, such as our art or language.  Cities remain the premiere example of human ingenuity and creativity.  These cities become seats of government and economics.   The gathering of minds that is humanity is most dense and potent in cities.  Without understanding how these man made megaliths function, one can never fully understand the human race.  A city is where humans become a society of humans and where the whole becomes greater than the sum of it's parts.
AMPMTF5IAAMK8	essay3	"It is true that people are fond of the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" mentality.  Many times we are content to lazily maintain the status quo at the expense of progress and fairness.  In this way scandals do serve a useful purpose.  The gossipy nature of the occurance has the power to mobilize humans in a grand scale.  As curious primates, we are  prone to only engage with things that are interesting and it is the scandals that pique our curiosity the most.  Scandals have frequently been the harbinger of social change from the french aristocracy during the revolution to all the changes the United States went through as a result of Watergate."
ANCCKNF1DKRZO	essay1	While it is true that human reliance on technology has increased and continues to increase over time, the argument that it will eventually lead to a a deterioration in human ability to think for themselves is simply not a convincing one. For one thing, technology does not function autonomously of human inputs and operation. That is, we need to be able to think critically in order to continue to innovate, and tweak, and make the technology work to our benefit. This alone suggests that it will bot happen without us. Also, we have innovated since the beginning of time and continue to do so, technology is no different in this way.
ANCCKNF1DKRZO	essay2	To understand the characteristics of a society, it is certainly true that one must study its major cities. Cities are essentially the nucleus of a place, and they quickly indicate to us how a city has developed, as well as where it has focused its resources and efforts, as this is where we tend to see buildings and infrastructure that speak to the practical needs of the society (historical and contemporary). That is, cities that used to be huge industrial hubs, for instance, still are comprised of old factories, buildings, railways, train tracks, and other symbols that tell the story of it's historical development.  Additionally, many cities today also give us as sense of the demographic composition of the place when we take a glance at the workday bustle of people going in and out of the city streets. We can quickly get a sense of race, age, and gender mix this way.  Further, whether a city has a lot of green parks etc te
ANCCKNF1DKRZO	essay3	The argument that scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could is true. This idea is certainly given support if we look at the political arena in the US today. For one thing, the Russia election scandal has driven the average American citizen to take a more involved and informed role in voting, government, and the political process generally, and issues with the same. This scandal alone has brought to light many of the shortcomings inherent in the US voting system, such as political  gerrymandering, the electoral college vote versus the popular vote, etc. These issues have all existed before the Russian collusion scandal. However, it is precisely the scandal that has now focused our attention on these issues in a way that no speaker or reformer ever has.  The same may be seen when we look at issues related to the me too movement. It is likely the scandal involving a media mogul that made this an important
ANVAFB99K5RKP	essay1	"Technology improves a person's ability to access information but it is not a replacement for problem solving; thus, human ability to think for themselves will not deteriorate. In the past, people thought that calculators would decrease mathematical ability, but this has not been the case. In fact, it allowed people to do MORE complex math quickly. In a similar way, technology allows the average individual access to tools that allow them to rely on themselves and not experts to solve complex issues. As the internet has arisen, more and more people have gotten involved in politics and social justice and are able to learn from others with niche knowledge. This has increased their ability to think critically as they are exposed to differing views. Even though some of it is indeed ""fake news"" and propaganda, this forces a person to confront dissidence between views and think more deeply."
ANVAFB99K5RKP	essay2	A society is more than just its major cities. In fact, while the major cities may have more people in them than the majority of other cities, the total rural or suburban population usually far exceeds the total population in the major cities. Thus, studying major cities will only give a person a rudimentary understanding of a society that will not apply to the majority of the population. Take, for example, China where major cities such as Beijing may be studied. However, a large proportion of China's 1 billion citizens live in rural areas where they are far removed from city lifestyle, culture, and norms. To just look at Beijing and other large Chinese cities to understand China would be like looking at a few ant farms in one's backyard in order to understand the whole backyard ecosystem. Sure, there are a lot of ants in those ant farms but they are tiny fraction of the entire yard.
ANVAFB99K5RKP	essay3	"Scandals are, unfortunately, useful because the media and the population in this day and age are drawn to them. Because people are highly interested in scandals in an almost ""tragedy porn"" or ""scandal porn"" manner, they may incentivize those people to learn more about the causes behind the scandal and to seek justice for the entire problem as a whole. This may include donating money or protesting to get laws changed, which can be highly beneficial to the underlying problem. This is unfortunate, but the end result can be very positive. For example, the recent sex abuse scandals in Hollywood have brought attention to the ways in which young starlets have been abused for years by powerful Hollywood executives. This has been a seedy part of Hollywood which people have known about but no action was taken until this recent scandals came into the limelight. Now abusers are being held accountable, which did not happen before."
AO33H4GL9KZX9	essay1	Augmentation of humans have already begun. It began a while ago actually. Our ancestors have used crutches for the injured wheelchairs for the lame. Nowadays, robotic limbs are not too uncommon to see. if it's acceptable to augment our physical attributes. why would it be so unusual for us to augment our mental abilities? As a matter of fact, the smartphone we all hold in our very hands are many hundred times more powerful than the computers used during the Nasa missions. The smartphone is essentially an extension of our mental abilities in a sense in that it can look up information on the vast network. On the other hand, it does limit our desire to think on an issue at depth because it gives the facts about an issue at an instant. it's only a matter of time before we see diminished mental abilities but it will always be augmented y increasingly more powerful computers.
AO33H4GL9KZX9	essay2	While cities often represent major portion of a populations, cultural centers, and intellectual hubs in a society, the characters are hardly defined by those reside in the cities. Cities make up small part of American landscape. And those who live in the cities represent small part of American values. Even to this date,if you imagine a picturesque landscape of the Americana, it will undoubtedly be a large farm, or a ranch--peaceful, independent, and hard working. We can certainly glimpse into a part of American psyche by looking at the character of cities, but to do so only for the cities is to limit oneself. We must look at the characters of the silent majority to truly understand our society.The same is true for other societies.
AO33H4GL9KZX9	essay3	Scandals are only scandals because they expose someone of something of some undesirable traits or events. And they have been used as weapons in political warfare for so many years, the negative connotation makes the scandals hardly allows us to focus our attention on what really matters--the real issue and the solutions. It's marginally true that they can reveal certain character about a person, but do they ever reveal something that helps us solve our problems? They never do, but they only detract. They can only considered as helpful in solving a problem if the problem is the opponent winning over your support, and the only way to win is to distract the masses by smearing the opponent. Hardly a way to solve any real problem in any significant ways.
AOKTAHY4F4J2B	essay1	While it's true that people are relying more and more on technology to solve problems, I sincerely do not think that the ability to think for themselves will deteriorate. Throughout history we've had more and more efficient ways to do things. We've improved planes, automobiles, tanks, weapons, and other forms of technology to make our lives easier. The iPhone has certainly made our lives easier and helped us solve problems. But the capacity to think for ourselves remains the same. I think having technology growing simply makes things easier and more efficient, but it does not substitute t thinking in the least. Having newer technology and more reliance upon is simply speeds the process up for everyone in re
AOKTAHY4F4J2B	essay2	This is true. I believe that most of the population is situated within the major cities in the world. Major cities are densely populated and tend to have certain characteristics that can easily be found in a major city as well. If we were to determine characteristics of a society from studying a rural town or farm, we will most certainly get inaccurate information.
AOKTAHY4F4J2B	essay3	No. Scandals are definitely not useful. They prove to only distract from bigger issues in our society. If there was a scandal involving celebrities or politicians, all it does is focus time, energy, and attention away from bigger problems such as homelessness, world hunger, and poverty. All a scandal does is focus all media attention on a small insignificant issue and hurts all other more important issues in the world today. Imagine having a scandal about Donald Trump sleeping with another woman that isn't his wife. Media coverage would be all over it which would distract everyone from doing more important things such as saving the environment or saving animals from excitation or further harm.
AOTCPS24JM5DQ	essay1	I agree with this statement above.  With humans having access to so many sources from technology we now have the ability to research anything via the web.  The ability to think for ourselves is becoming a thing in the past.  Due to google, and various other search engines we can now find everything on the web.  With that being said we rely more on technology to solve problems .
AOTCPS24JM5DQ	essay2	I agree with this statement .  You should understand your city because you need to know what your dealing with .  Without understand your city you will not know the characteristics of your society.  I am a believer of this statement.  I think this is very accurate.
AOTCPS24JM5DQ	essay3	I disagree with this statement because this is not always the case.  Scandals can be very harmful because of the harm that they can cause to us.  Speakers can give more input in my opinion.  Also this statement has no real meaning behind it.  So in my opinion this is a bad isssue.
APGUE1GWCW0MX	essay1	I don't believe that technology will influence people's decision making abilities. The worst it can do is feed people the wrong information. Humans have an innate ability to judge right from wrong that can be shaped by the real world consequences they see when they make a decision, and technology won't change that. I think we will become more cognizant of the effect of upbringing on our children and will begin to fight
APGUE1GWCW0MX	essay2	The major influence of cities is to increase the numbers of interactions between people, which by its nature, will eventually bring out every iteration of those interactions. I do believe it's true that studying these interactions will help understand the plight of human nature. There is however the issue of supply of essential services in these cities which will change the results. If we want the best results, we should look at cities the have the lowest poverty and unemployment levels to understand what will happen in society.
APGUE1GWCW0MX	essay3	This seems to be true for many things. Rhetoric can and is used to change people''s opinion on topics, and most of the time it's used to gloss over the negative aspects of certain situations. If the entire truth of a scandal is revealed we have a better picture of what's really happening. If we let the people who want to control the narrative do so, history can be changed in ways that are negative and detrimental. Scandals should be studied in order to get to the truth of the matter so history can't be written by the winners.
APNTEGPF7QZQI	essay1	As technology increases, the burden of having to reason and think logically and reasonably about problems decreases. There are apps for almost every type of science or math problems that take away the reasoning process. Education of young students is becoming less and less important and relying more on modern technology even for basic communication. Skills for jobs are diminishing because new technology has taken the process of solving a problem by rationale away. Thinking is becoming a lost skill.
APNTEGPF7QZQI	essay2	Major cities have an eclectic population. Melting pots of many different ethnic and culturally diversified people all in one place. Rural and suburban communities do not have the same mixing of many different people. Society, as a whole, is defined by all of its people collectively. If there is only a couple of cultures or ethnicities represented, it does not give a clear view of society characteristics. It only provides a narrow scope as opposed to a major city with many different people. Major cities have larger populations from many different backgrounds and provide a larger picture of societal characteristics.
APNTEGPF7QZQI	essay3	"Diversion from problems is easy when a seemingly unimportant issue is presented. People tend to focus on the short-term problems or diversions rather than wanting to take a long time to pay attention to the big picture. Scandals provide an instant relief and diversion to focus the attention away from real issues of importance. Many claim the ""false fire"" method is employed by the government to distract attention away from the real issues and the importance of solving them. People become obsessed in the scandal, even if momentarily, as a relief from the mundane problems that they face."
APRZ7BR8C0ZMQ	essay1	When I was young and growing up in the 1970s if you wanted to find out new information on anything you had to look it up.  Now...looking it up then, wasn't what it is now.  For me, I grew up in Arkansas, in the middle of a national forest..on some old homesteaded land from many decades before.  It was about 20 miles to the nearest telephone.  It was a pay phone.  Looking something up on a phone would have been to wild to imagine.   The point is..if I wanted to find out new information, I would have to travel some distance, and would have to get to a library or the school (which also had a library).  I would have had to know how to look things up.  I would also have had to know how to discern if this info. was real or not.  I would have had to, maybe ask someone, talk to neighbors to find out.  Maybe a wealthyish neighbor had new and up to date encyclopedias, even.   I would have had to really use my physical and mental energy to find out.  Oh and math...I would have had to work things out long hand.  No easy cell phones to look things up.. the newish calculators..not allowed.  Same with typing school.. I had a typing class.
APRZ7BR8C0ZMQ	essay2	Cities are the melting pots of societies..and they are also it's pressure cookers.  Take a city like London, or New York.  These are great draws..and people from all over (Much longer in London) came to share ideas and work.  People who aspired to anything went there.  If you study history, you'd find this to be true.  I think it holds true that these places reflect the feel and economy of the states or countries they are in.  The farmlands are the stomachs or breadbaskets.. if you will, of the country, but the cities are the brains.    Cities are the places where MAJOR schools are.  They are the places where it's culture is.  They are where people go to REALLLY PRODUCE things.  If you want to see a cultural thing..like a play.. you go to the city.  if you want art, you go to a city.  I think you will agree that a location Like Amsterdam, or Venice, or timbuktu... these are important.. they are what you would study to KNOW about a people.  If you want to find English..go to London.. America New york.
APRZ7BR8C0ZMQ	essay3	"Scandals bring out the worst and the best in people.  It is true..that when something big and negative happens, people pay attention.  A scandal is what brought Nixon Down.  A scandal is what has brought a lot of Men down.. What with the Me Too movement.  This is something happening right now..that is receiving a lot of light and attention.  I think things are really just happening because of it.  When people are abused, and lied to, they get angry...and they want change.  This is often the impetus of change.  If someone is the ""poster boy"" for anything bad.. it often gives those wanting change to rally against.    It is important to note that History is full of these type of things...  Lady Godiva..Caused a scandal.. Writers like Oscar Wilde.. Scandal.. BUT he really drew peoples attention to the plight of gay men.  I appreciate that, being Gay myself. The same is true of Aids.. I am HIV pos.   Because of the scandals of Reagan ignoring Hiv...i am alive today. I have drugs"
AQJWO4YPR3LUQ	essay1	People rely so heavily on technology to do things for them they don't think nearly as much as they used too.  The number one example I can think of that comes to mind is the ability of people to count change back particularly those that work retail or service jobs.  People have come so reliable on calculators they have lost the ability to compute numbers without them.  I have witnessed myself cashiers who had a mess up on the register and then they must get out calculator to figure change back.  I also think when it comes to research people rely heavily on the internet and sometimes find false information.  Long gone are the times when people would look up correct information in an actual book.
AQJWO4YPR3LUQ	essay2	I think studying a large city is the best way to figure out the characteristics in society.  In large cities there is a huge melting pot of multiple different individuals.  When you do the same research in small cities or towns you aren't getting as much diversity so you're losing lots of different examples of individuals.  I think in major cities also people don't care as much and you can more readily see their true characteristics because they just don't care as much about their fellow humans. When trying to figure out the most important characteristics in society getting as many different people as possible would be the most likely way to come to a good conclusion.
AQJWO4YPR3LUQ	essay3	Scandals uncover things about society that is usually not brought to much attention because most involve something that is so wrong no one wants to talk about it.  As a society we try to keep awful things hidden in the shadows and not really talk about the most important issues.  Finding out how horrible human beings can actually be is something that helps us to plan for things we never think possible because we don't discuss them.  When we uncover scandals we can also better learn how to handle similar problems in the future as well. I think focusing on problems in society more is useful to all of us even when most like to live in the dark about important issues.
AQSB97UW88SO2	essay1	People's ability to think for themselves will surely deteriorate as people rely more on technology. This can be easily observed in the trends of technology that mankind has experienced so far. For instance, take a look at social media. Once people started relying on it, they became obsessed with it and made it a focal point of their life--even if what they share on their profiles might not reflect who they actual are as people. Another example would be the emerging AI trend that will be huge in the future, along with robotics. Jobs have already been replaced by this technology, but also, people use AI to remind them when they have appointments or when they need to work out. This trend of relying less on oneself and, instead, relying on something else to work for them, will make mankind complacent and unable to adapt to sudden changes in the future. Their ability to think for themselves will dissipate entirely.
AQSB97UW88SO2	essay2	To understand the important characteristics of society, it is important to study major cities. This is due to the fact that the largest concentration of people live in major cities, and society is a construct of how people live and interact with one another. By studying how people intermingle with one another, one can grasp the underlying details that make up a society as a whole. Peeling away the layers of society in major cities is the only way to truly delve deep into what makes up the foundation of a group of people: their goals, motivations, religions, ideals, and ultimately their basic nature as a whole. Only these minute details can be viewed with maximum detail in major cities since it requires a network of connected individuals.
AQSB97UW88SO2	essay3	"Scandals are useful to draw away a large group of people's attention in every day life. Grabbing attention of others is no easy feat, but when a major ""happening"" is going on, it catches on like wildfire. This can be observed in the news, and others might add fuel to the fire by making it into a meme. Speakers' and reformers' major goal is to capture individuals' attention, but sometimes it is a little too forced and the efforts prove to be futile. Only when absurdity is found in its natural form, which is often times the major aspect of scandals, can peoples' attention be truly grasped, and in a way like no other. People latch onto ideas and feelings when scandals are discovered, and no other form of attention can be grabbed better."
ARB80JPV0HQ5O	essay1	Technology has made people more lazy. For example: the calculator. Instead of being able to solve math problems by using ones brain, all one needs to do is plug numbers into a machine to get an answer. This makes people more reliant on machines for answers than themselves. The more people use machines to think for them, the less people think for themselves. Technology has made peoples lives easier and as a result people have grown accustomed to having things done for them instead of doing things for themselves.
ARB80JPV0HQ5O	essay2	A city lets you know the kind of people living in it. For example, if you visit New York City, you will immediately notice how multicultural it is. There are people from all walks of life living in New York. This lets you know that New York is a city that welcomes all people. No matter how one might perceive the average newyorker, the fact that he/she lives with so many different types of people lets you know that more often than not, they have experience dealing with a culture far different from their own, and that they are not confined into a space that looks and sounds the same. People who are different from them are not alien.
ARB80JPV0HQ5O	essay3	Scandals are more of a distraction than something useful. They distract people from far more important issues. Scandals are a means of generating ratings and keeping people from focusing on real problems and issues. Governments and media use scandals as means of dumbing down the population. For media, its selling you advertisement by gluing you to their channel or print. For government its focusing your attention on smaller issues rather than more complicated issues such as war and poverty.
ARLGZWN6W91WD	essay1	People who begin to rely on technology to do simple tasks for them, will become dependent on them. It takes away their ability to do these tasks on their own. They are lured in by the convenience that technology offers and they slowly begin to loose the independence of doing it on their own. For example social interactions. If they rely on technology to complete many of their social interactions they will loose the  ability to interact in person, because they have become so reliant in the technology. This can be seen with many things such as using a calculator, or writing things out versus typing.
ARLGZWN6W91WD	essay2	I do not agree that to study a society, one must study the cities. The people that live in cities behave completely differently than those in the country. Living more removed from big cities, allows one to have the freedom of space, but also the boredom of little to do. People in the country seem to be more simple and less reliant on things. To study the most important characteristics of society, one must study groups of people from all parts of the society, not just one.
ARLGZWN6W91WD	essay3	I think scandals can be important in our society. Look at the Harvey Weinstein scandal for example. Until all those women came out and accused him of sexual misconduct, so many people we in the dark about sexual harassment in the workplace. Millions of women came forward with their stories in the Me Too movement and that was all started by the original scandal. This is something that was swept under the rug and because of a scandal it was brought to the forefront. I think scandals can be a great catalyst for change.
ARTSG66V2MOJ6	essay1	I believe the advent of new technology actually helps us think for ourselves in ways we have not thought before. While it is true that technology helps us solve problems, it does not necessarily mean we cannot think for ourselves.. I can relate to this on a personal level, having used the calculator on my smartphone for simple math numerous times, and I am fairly certain I am not alone in this. Allowing the computers and smartphones do some of our work for us lets us spend time together and talk more often. Another example is the dishwasher. While it does the dishes, I can sit on my couch and talk with my wife and discuss our day. The everyday convenience of not having to stand over the sink or the stove lets us mingle with people.
ARTSG66V2MOJ6	essay2	"Major cities often consist of people from all parts of the country, that is true. However, you will find that most people in major cities hail from that geographic area. Thus you will not get a true picture of a society's most important characteristics. I think you have to look outside the major cities as well. It would be better to get a group of people from both rural and urban areas and average out their characteristics. If this was true, you would think Americans were all city-dwelling and left-leaning. While there is truth that many Americans are liberal, large parts of rural America hold conservative values. It is hard to form a picture of a society by only looking at big cities. Big city people from my experience tend to always be in a hurry, have short fuses and generally in an unfriendly mood. This is not the picture I have of America. I see the people as friendly toward each other, always saying ""Hello, how are you?"" and willing to help someone if they need it."
ARTSG66V2MOJ6	essay3	Our current White House administration stands as a good example of this very issue. I think scandals are useful to a certain point. Allowing news to report on too many of these scandals muddy the waters, and distracts us from what is really going on. Take for instance the case with President Trump and his alleged porn star affair. It has received much attention, which has taken our focus away from the fact that millions of people might be losing health care in the south. This story concerning Trump also makes us forget that there is a deep investigation into his other dealings concerning Russia and election meddling. I feel that all of these rumors and scandals distract us from the important matters in politics and daily lives, though to a certain point they help us see what is going on at the top.
ASI2B6A3Y556Z	essay1	Technology has already decreased the ability of people to think for themselves, and the problem will continue to get worse as technology advances.  There are several well known examples of thinking ability declining already.  One example is the problem that a significant number of people have doing basic math problems without a calculator.  Another example is they way people rely on spell check and grammar programs instead of their own language ability.  I think that this is bound to happen because in general people tend to look for the easiest way possible to accomplish something.  If using technology is easier than thinking, people will naturally gravitate towards using the technology.
ASI2B6A3Y556Z	essay2	It is definitely possible to tell the most important characteristics of a society by studying its major cities.  This is true because cities have large groups of people that reflect the general make up of society.  The problems that are present in the cities are simply the society's problems magnified due to the large populations.  I think you can tell a great deal about the US by studying New York and Los Angeles.  You can tell a lot about Europe by studying Paris and London.  However, it is not possible to tell everything about a society by studying its cities, because there are significant differences between the cultural in the cities and rural cultures.
ASI2B6A3Y556Z	essay3	Scandals can be useful as  a way of focusing much needed attention on a given issue.  Sometimes without a scandal it is nearly impossible to stir up enough passion to bring about change.  However, sometimes scandals aren't connected to any important issue.  Instead they can be about something relatively frivolous and can actually distract from issues that really need our attention.  Scandals also tend to fizzle out killing any real chance of reform.  Often a charismatic, passionate leader who can sustain the movement will be more effective than a scandal that people will soon forget.
ASTDBTVY3WP1K	essay1	To a certain extent, I agree that the evolution of and easy access to technology will deteriorate people's ability to think for themselves.  A simple example is a calculator. When I was a kid, my parents and teachers did not allow the use of a calculator. Instead, we memorized and recited multiplications tables. We learned how to do long division and such. To this day, I am quite good at math and can solve most problems mentally or with paper and pencil.  Beyond that, computers and the internet have made us lazy in some ways. We used to go to the library to do research. We'd look up subjects in a card catalog, locate the books we needed, then read them and take notes in order to compile information and formulate opinions.  These days, we have so much information at our fingertips. Certainly there are benefits to that. However, it also allows us to not have to think very hard, form our own opinions, or ask more questions.  As well, the introduction of digital assistants (Alexa, Siri, etc) allows us to store so much digitally. We no longer have to learn to read a bus schedule or arrange our own calen
ASTDBTVY3WP1K	essay2	I believe that, to an extent, studying our major cities will allow us to understand important characteristics of society.  Major cities are densely populated. They also house citizens or all walks of life---ultra wealthy, impoverished, homeless, middle class, etc.  Big cities also generally have a very mixed demographic when it comes to races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, etc.  Because of all of that, studying cities gives one a vast cross-section of human beings to observe.  Conversely, studying a suburban or rural society gives you much less perspective on overall society. Most suburbs are middle to upper class and majority white.  Rural areas are often lower income and people tend to live more independently. They many not have to see or interact with other community members as frequently as urban dwellers.  When you study smaller areas, you miss out on a lot of demographics.  You also don't get as clear a picture of how people from various groups and classes interact with and around one another.
ASTDBTVY3WP1K	essay3	Scandals can be useful. When a scandal is revealed it showcases a significant issue that, in many cases, has great bearing on society.  Scandals also attract more attention from the general public. This is because scandals are often salacious. Tawdry details tend to really grab most people's attention. As such, people start talking, sharing information and opinions, etc.   This is what can lead to change for the better. When people are outraged, disgusted, horrified, disappointed by facts (a scandal), many feel compelled to search for answers and to come up with a plan to correct or eliminate the person or organization who is responsible for the scandal. As an example, the #MeToo Movement. There have been many abusers revealed and called out. Harvey Weinstein is an obvious example. Because so many women spoke out and revealed facts about his behavior, Hollywood (and the world) became angry. Many people banned together to demand change. Weinstein is suffering consequences, as are others. It's a small step but, one that would not have been taken had it not been
ASYBJEOL466J6	essay1	The older I get the more I realize that technology is really becoming a crutch that too many people are reliant on. When I was in high school no one had a cell phone and social media did not exist, but we all got by. People would not have full conversations with their cell phones but with each other and no one had a kindle or Ereader, you went to the library. I also feel that because of texting especially, the degradation of the english language is happening, no one is thinking in complete sentences, only in text. People have stopped learning new information about one another through old fashioned ways like conversation and now solely rely on instagram and facebook for all of their information. In truth, I no longer no any phone numbers, it is just names in my phone which would be very ba
ASYBJEOL466J6	essay2	Most societies put their pinnacle of class and distinction in their major cities. They are the cultural and intellectual hubs for many countries. But I also think you can learn a lot from the rural and suburban communities in any society. I feel that the bulk of people live outside of the few main cities in any society. To say that you can not learn the main or important characteristics of a society from these communities is very limiting and unfair to everyone living in them. There is a lot of culture and diversity found outside of a city and a lot of major characteristics from a society can be learned from the everyday lives of these normal ordinary citizens.
ASYBJEOL466J6	essay3	A scandal is absolutely an efficient way to get a story to the front and center of the general public. A well prepared speech or debate cannot compete with a major breaking scandal, the public wants to be entertained. This has never been more prevelant then with what is happening right now with our current political climate. It seems like the current administration thrives on scandal and uses it as a diversionary tactic to steer the public away from areas that they do not want them to focus on. An example of this would be our president making an outrageous claim through twitter that he was being spied on by the former administration to take away attention from his travel ban or issues with Russia. This has proven to be very effective if he is any example.
AT3C00TKZK13L	essay1	If you do not use it, you lose it; thats what happens when you stop using your brain for thinking, socializing, normal day to day interactions. As humans become more technological advanced, we also stop being human. We become less sensible to tragedies. We only care about progress, money, performance. What about feelings? That is what makes us human in the first place.
AT3C00TKZK13L	essay2	Major cities in the world such as Paris, Hong Kong, and New York are example of what makes a society. These cities are made up of people from all over the world. Main cities will always have a large immigrant population. These societies will also have poor, middle class and rich people mingling with each other. These major cities are densely populated, and have a variety of jobs to be taken.
AT3C00TKZK13L	essay3	Scandals serve one purpose: To fixate on it and obsess over every detail. People like scandals because it focuses on an issue. This issue has many aspect, and so the media tries to cover every single detail. Scandals like watergate or shootings try to cover as much as possible and people embrace it. People will always like a conflict. People feed off scandals because we are noisy by nature.
ATCU3JC12ZH0N	essay1	As technology becomes more advanced, people rely less and less on other forms of doing  tasks. The ability to think for oneself will deteriorate as technology is advanced, but these abilities will be replaced with new abilities. Since the invention of the calculator basic math has deteriorated. for example, most schools no longer teach long division. Their response is what is the point if one can just use a calculator, phone or computer in am instant to obtain the required information. another argument could be in spelling. more and more papers are completed on computers with spell check than in a notebook written in cursive. the ability to spell diminishes as one simple has to write how they think a word is spelled and auto-correct or spell check will fix it for them. A person will never know  A word like bureaucracy wi
ATCU3JC12ZH0N	essay2	One must study a society's major cities to understand it's society, but that cannot be the only piece of a puzzle. the major cities will tell someone how they distribute water, power, do business and many other factors, but a society is not just it's cities. It is the land as a whole to include the outside farmers who supply the cities with food. language is another factor that can say a lot about a society, what are the customary words used in their language? How do they address younger or older people? Do they use the same words for everyone? or do they differentiate in their speech? there is so much one can learn about a society, but  through more avenues than simply studying the major cities.
ATCU3JC12ZH0N	essay3	Scandals are not useful. Our attention is focused on a scandal because it happened, not because our attention needs to be focused on scandals that do not happen. A scandal is a black eye in the face of an organization, company, family unit or government. At times one scandal happens and facts come into light showing more harm and scandals. In that sense alone a scandal coming out can be good, but only in that small fraction of a sense. Overall scandals harm people and are never good for any reason. The scandal can be brought to light by other means.
ATF7HBD1TFI2U	essay1	It is clear that people are relying more on technology for answers and information. When I was a kid, we had to go to the library and do our own research. Now, all you need to do is google it. So much so that the word google has become a verb. You could argue that this puts more information into people's hand, which is true. However, the ability to rely on a computer has made people more prone to find the quick answer rather than studying the subject further.
ATF7HBD1TFI2U	essay2	Its important to look at the major cities when trying to evaluate characteristics of society because these cities will be the most diverse cities giving you a better consensus. For example, if you look at a small city in Kansas, you won't find a wide range of people to survey. Of course its possible that personalities are likely to be similar across the country but if you only hit one demographic you might be lacking the appropriate information. The larger cities in the country will give you more diversity. Small cities will be lacking.
ATF7HBD1TFI2U	essay3	"Scandals are useful because they teach of lessons. We learn best from our mistakes and can learn from other people's mistakes as well. Of course, scandals mean that something bad has happened to someone and you could argue that is never useful. I believe that from scandals we can develop good legislation that protects people in the long run. It brings to light the things that can happen to us. People are so quick to say ""That would never happen to me"", but when it happens to someone you can relate to, it opens you up to the possibility to it happening to you. Exposing things that are typically left in the dark help us learn to protect ourselves better and look out for threats."
AU1QJZII0OBN5	essay1	As the population grows to rely more on technology, humans will continue to think independently. Technology can mean a variety of things, and the continued growth of it is only possible due to human intelligence. After all, behind each electronic update, there was a human, or several, who created it. Speaking more widely about the internet's effect on the general population, it is important to remember that with the internet comes a wealth of information that was never before so widely accessible. If the internet was structured into several books set up in a massive library, nobody would be complaining about its effect on the human mind. The internet provides the general population with incredible amounts of information about a massive amount of subjects. That is something that should be celebrated and praised, not criticized with conspiracies about its harm.
AU1QJZII0OBN5	essay2	To understand important characteristics of a society, I believe it is important to study major cities. This is where the majority of the population can be found in a condensed space, and as a result you will be able to quickly peruse through various different ways of living in a society. It is common knowledge that cities often hold bigger and better displays of the cultures found in an area, compared to exploring a rural area that may only have a few displays of culture that are few and far between. With the study of culture comes the knowledge of food preferences, sayings, and traditions. Mannerisms will be easily identified as a trait of a community vs. an individual preference when you can study a multitude of people all at once, which is more doable in a city.
AU1QJZII0OBN5	essay3	"No one can say that scandals aren't attention grabbing. They engage a whole community, whether or not they had any direct involvement in the situation. Suddenly, even people who are only distantly connected want to hear the latest news, the shocking truth of what happened. It is the same reason why every plot of a TV show or movie will have drama, and why telenovelas are so popular. A scandal takes a theory, something that was only before discussed as a ""could be"", into a reality. It morphs a discussion from predictions and theories into reality, which is different from anything a speaker or reformer could do. It is also the reason why they are so engaging. What happens when fiction becomes reality? It gets everyone captivated and creating real discussions and arguments."
AU2RMH9IZP60M	essay1	To a certain extent, I believe this statement will be slightly true but mostly false.  Looking at all other generations that didn't have as much technology, there have always been people that simply wanted more in life.  There will be a class of people that simply use and allow technology to do everything for them and there will be a class of people that still choose to educate themselves and progress in life.  Besides, someone has to continue to program and maintain the technology if it cannot take care of itself.  I also think that with the extra time humans have because of technology, we will have more time to learn even more things in life.
AU2RMH9IZP60M	essay2	I agree with this statement.  If one needs to learn about a society they need a large data sample to work from and a city will provide this.  Of course rural areas and such will not be accurately represented but having the largest data sample is what's important here.  Thanks to the large population of a place's city, many different characteristics will be represented.  I simply think it's more important to reach as many different characteristics as possible than to reach the extra 2-5% outside of a major city.
AU2RMH9IZP60M	essay3	I definitely agree with this statement.  For the longest, scandals have been used in extremely effective ways when it comes to diverting attention.  There are tons of people who aren't interested in regular news, don't want to read, or anything that should be paying attention to certain issues.  Until one of their favorite celebrities get involved in a scandal involving X problem or the president gets involved in his own scandal, they simply don't care.  A prime example is how people outing sexual misconduct in hollywood recently sparked the Metoo movement and encouraged people that were victims of sexual abuse to speak up.  Scandals can be great for things like that.
AUAKXBVRC9D6S	essay1	I agree with this statement, because it seems that more people are relying on the anonymity of technology to face their problems. People do not have to learn anymore either, their smartphones ensure they have all the information they need in the palm of their hands. It is disheartening to not be able to have a conversation with someone without them picking up their phone for one reason or another. Conversations are less personal when they are had over text message, and problem solving cannot occur when people are not entirely sure of the context of the situation. People should be more focused on committing more pertinent information to long term memory instead of relying on short term memory due to their infinite knowledge on their phones.
AUAKXBVRC9D6S	essay2	Due to the fact that the population is made up almost entirely of people in the major cities, I agree with this statement. There are many more people from many different socio-economic classes in urban areas. Having lived in cities and rural areas, I have seen the diversity a city holds. There are more opinions in the cities which offer more insight on the society itself. I have also noticed a great deal of urbanites learning about rural areas and the happenings outside of their city, so that can be significant in itself. There is more knowledge to be had and less time to be spent if one stays in the city to conduct any research on the society.
AUAKXBVRC9D6S	essay3	I disagree with this statement due to recent coverage of scandals over more important things, like happenings in other countries that greatly impact our own. It seems like the scandals are heavily covered while things that are more important are swept under the rug, never to be heard again. Scandals are only important to the people that want to do something malicious without the media coverage. I think journalism can be more useful when covering things that don't have to do with the personal lives of people in power. It is a waste when news outlets are focused on scandals rather than the more important laws being passed under our noses. Usually people are entirely too focused on these scandals to even know what the government is doing. Scandals are also ways to keep irrelevant people relevant for the wrong reasons.
AUAN582MLI96N	essay1	I strongly agree.  We rely on map apps to provide us direction, calculators to do math, stored contacts to communicate with people and banking apps to balance our checkbook.  More and more we rely on automation and less on using our brain to track, learn and work through responsibilities.  We even set up auto drafts so we don't have to actually make payments when do, they do it for us.
AUAN582MLI96N	essay2	I disagree.  Major cities are just a part of society.  There is usually a specific type of person who lives within the city.  To understand society as a whole you need to look collectively at cities of all sizes along with smaller towns and rural areas as they all tie together to form a society,
AUAN582MLI96N	essay3	I tend to agree with this.  Scandals hit the airwaves and TV and bring to light things that typically go on undetected,  An example is the use of torture.  If this wasn't brought out no one would be aware it goes on and what the implications are.  Same with political scandals and sexual harassment.  Scandals are usually not isolated and go on normally in the realm it takes place, so its good to bring those to our attention.
AVJUIF9QHQRY8	essay1	I believe this statement to be true. Due to our use of technology and how it makes our lives better, I think it is highly possible to assume this. Think about the questions we can simple ask our phones to get the answer. We are very dependent of our phones. We spend our time browsing social media, shopping, and judging others from a mile away. This society has grown to where we would rather binge watch tv and browse social media than pick up a book and learn something new. This is not speaking for all humans but a majority of them,
AVJUIF9QHQRY8	essay2	I think this statement somewhat applies. There is so much to see in this world, but major cities usually lie the heart of society. Major cities are built up of monopoly companies and that is where you will find the majority of people. Big city society is built up to represent the majority of people. A lot of issues stem from big cities. Things like  money, politics, and power are stem from major cities. Society is influenced by what the majority is doing.
AVJUIF9QHQRY8	essay3	I do not agree that scandals are good but they can be useful when it comes to grabbing our attention. When we hear of a major scandal we become highly invest with only more questions. Many times these scandals can lead to a bigger issue and then we begin doing things so that it never happens again. People are help responsible and that is very useful. In the light of a scandal we see movements form and laws get changed. We see society come together and sometimes that can be a good or bad thing depending on the issue. Sometimes it cause controversy  of a bigger issue.
AVQGY7FCU80XP	essay1	I think that human will always do some things better than computers.  Computers will be able to provide data and recognize patterns faster than humans.  However, humans are in general more creative than artificial intelligence computers.  As a result, computers can beat humans in chess but and as capable as humans in creating art.  Humans will never complete relinquishes their ability to think for themselves and decide their own fate to a computer; even though they may rely on a computer for advice or information.  Besides, humans have to write and create the computers and the code for the programs.  I think humans will also control computers in one way or the other and be the final decision maker.
AVQGY7FCU80XP	essay2	I think that cities can provide a lot of information about humanity.   The main reason is that cities are densely populated and there are a lot of human interactions.  It is very easy to observe and study relate to each other on a daily basis.  However, there is a lot of information about humanity can be divided about humanity outside of the cities.  For example, farmers in rural areas have to rely on each other and work together for their farms to be successful.  People outside of the cities have a lot of different and unique experiences that people that live in a city.  In other to understand society one must study people from a variety of situations and environments.
AVQGY7FCU80XP	essay3	Scandals are usually a result of someone exploit the system or breaking the rules.  Scandals expose this in a public way versus a speaker talking about reformer to a smaller and more limited audience.  Also, a scandal usually requires a more immediate resolution.  A person that wants reformer is trying to convince other people to take action which may require a lot of time.  Scandals demonstrate a problem more clearly and demands action more that a speaker may be capable of doing depending on the person's status and power.
AW06DHUMM00YZ	essay1	I don't necessarily agree the ability to think will deteriorate, but it will change.  Technology improves the human condition in many ways, and makes new things possible or more efficient.  That is a change, and in some cases might cause people to stop maintaining older skills in favor of simply reaching for the technological solution; but it's simply a shift in thinking.  For example, raw knowledge used to reside only in the library, in books that had to be laboriously reviewed to reference facts or details.  Now, with search engines, knowledge can be efficiently sorted and brought to a human's attention.  The humans need less ability to find information, but more ability to understand and process information that's relevant.  Change is life, and people need to keep up.  Fearing change, especially technological change, is a trap that leads to an inability to cope with what will come next.  Training yourself to think flexibly is the best path forward, and the most likely route to staying current and relevant even in the face of technological change.  Dealing with new technology requires new thought, and the ability to understand innovation.  That's thinking for yourself, if you are going to keep up.
AW06DHUMM00YZ	essay2	The structure of society, and the things it finds the most important, can definitely be found in how that society lives.  And not just in culture or habits, but in how its cities and living spaces are arranged.  A society that values access and ease of mobility, for example, will ensure transportation routes are logical, efficient, and allow that city's inhabitants to more easily make use of the services and locations within that city.  Conversely, societies that value restriction and placing barriers to ensure some citizens are encouraged to not participate in the city and its activities will pay little, if any, attention to how easily citizens can move about the city.  This can be seen in the European versus American models of cities; European cities generally have accessible transportation, while American cities insist on cars that are expensive to maintain and operate.  These qualities transfer to the countries these cities are found in, in political policies and general structure of laws.  A city does reflect its society, and studying them gives insight into the people of that society.
AW06DHUMM00YZ	essay3	It is a sad fact that something dramatic and exciting makes for a better story, and not only better news but also how likely people are to pay attention to it.  Further, such events can help place a face on an issue or event, and help cast it into a context the average person can more easily understand.  It shouldn't require such extents to get a problem or situation noticed to the point where it will be addressed, even corrected, but very often it does.  Even great reformers throughout history have still needed, or relied upon, dramatic scandal-type events to push through the change they advocated for.  In the modern social media era, this is more true than ever; that scandal draws attention and cries for change.  If something is below the radar of most people, it stays as it is no matter how much it might need altering.  But if it becomes noticeable, suddenly people become concerned.  Scandals shouldn't be required to fix problems, but until human nature is willing to invest in itself, it's unlikely scandal will become a distraction rather than a necessity.
AWAW665TQQP2F	essay1	With the inevitable increase of technology there has to be a balance in the order of things. Machines and programs are doing more of our work for us and as a result we are doing less things for ourselves. An example are machinized jobs that used to provide work and subsequently an income for hundreds of thousands of people. The machines are now doing the work for us (IE self checkout at Walmart) and therefore more people are being laid off while we allow ourselves to climb the technology ladder and leave our potential behind. In a world where life is at the touch of a button or available in an app as a society we have stopped thinking and doing for ouselves because we are no longer faced with having to do anything for ourselves. We have electric vacuums that clean our floors for us without us pushing them, we have cars that drive themselves, we have machines that make things for us, and fridges that tell us when we should go buy more food. When did we become a world that needed told when to purchase more milk? We are headed in a horrible direction but we don't notice it because an app hasn't told us yet.
AWAW665TQQP2F	essay2	To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.. I disagree with this. To know about a particular city, sure, study that city, but to know about a region or a society of people one must look further and broader than major cities. Our society is more than just the hustle and bustle of ignorant strangers in dense populous filled smoke streets of crime and greed. Our society is the little town where the young boy helps a grandmother carry her groceries to her car without being asked. Our society is the small dairy farm that teaches about the natural cycle of life to the inquiring minds of kindergarteners on a field trip. Our society is made up of so many wonderful things and so many scary things and so many amazing things that it cannot all be show in just major cities. Our society is made up of laid back people who still write letters, trucks that deliver milk, the local bar where everyone knows each other, and yes it is made up of skyscrapers, Madison square garden, and crime filled alleys. Major cities are a part of our society but our society is more than major cities.
AWAW665TQQP2F	essay3	Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could is true. It's sickening, but it's true. When there is a scandal or some juicy bit of celebrity gossip or political faus pax there is no way any reporter or paparazzi could do a better job of highlighting that problem for us than the candid realism of how disgusting we now are as a society in general that we are entertained by these things. It used to be a wonder to attend a seminar or lecture to learn things and become involved in things beyond oneself. Instead we are now so intent on the daily gossip and scandal that we race to our social media and our trashy tabloids to learn the latest tidbit. Gone are the days where people were more focused on real life and real people telling truth rather than telling tales to make a quick buck.
AWPB724OHY99T	essay1	I believe this statement is true, and warrants a discussion. I think that people being able to use auto correct and instantly google any form of information is reducing their willingness to learn. The fact that everyone has this much power of knowledge creates a society where everyone believes they are right. Most people do not even go to the doctor anymore because they self diagnose on google. I think that it is a little too much power for every person to have, but there is not very much you can do about it. The world is how it is now and that's just the way it has to be.
AWPB724OHY99T	essay2	I disagree with this, because most cities are unrelated to the grand scheme of the country. I believe that we all work together, even though we are separated by state lines and county lines. I think that to understand the importance of society is to study the people themselves, not where they live in the country. I think that to better understand this subject you should be looking deeper into the every day persons life, and struggles. This is a difficult task but I think a necessary one.
AWPB724OHY99T	essay3	It's true that scandals have the ability to shine light on issues one might not have thought up themselves. I think they do have a role, however I do not believe they should receive as much attention as they do. The world seems to focus around scandals and the latest gossip, I do not think this is good for future generations. I believe that we should take the lessons learned from scandals and leave it at that. Instead of focusing on them non stop, until there is nothing even left to talk about anymore.
AXJ1PE87PD0KK	essay1	I agree that the increase in using technology will cause human ability to think for themselves to deteriorate. For example, in grade school, I learned how to do mental math or use a paper and pencil to solve math problems. Now, I have forgotten almost all the basics that I learned in school because I just use a calculator on my phone or put the math problem into google. Additionally, I do not feel like I need to memorize information or numbers because I can just search for it. I have not memorized a friend's phone number in years.  In more concerning topics, people fail to think for themselves when they read information on social media. I am from a small town and see many friends on social media share articles that they believe to be true but after quick research they end up being false. For example, one of my Facebook friends shared an article about a dinosaur egg hatching due to an issue in the cooling system at a museum. If they had not blindly believed what they read online, they may have recalled some of what they learned about fossils in school. They seem to think articles on the internet have authority.
AXJ1PE87PD0KK	essay2	I do not agree that to learn the most important characteristics of a society, one most study its major cities. I do believe that cities are a center point for culture. Thus, studying a major city may give a person a quicker understanding because resources are condensed. However, it would not give the full picture of what society is really like. For example, many countries, such as India and the United States, have large agricultural economies. Are the huge subsections of farmers not an important part of society? One would be unlikely or unable to learn about these types of people by only visiting a city. Overall, I believe to get a full understanding of the important characteristics of a society, it would be important to travel. There are different cultural and societal norms in both urban and rural areas even within the same society.
AXJ1PE87PD0KK	essay3	I think that scandals serve a certain purpose, but I think that speakers and reformers are also important. Scandals expose issues that are occurring. Many people have a hard time seeing or believing an issue is as serious as a speaker or reformer is claiming. For example, some people tried to speak out and warn civilians about the US government experimenting on citizens with mind control and drugs. It was thought of as crazy and no one believed the speakers. However, eventually information was declassified about Project MKUltra and a huge scandal pursued. People were very upset that the government used these techniques. This lead to more attention to the issue and more call for government transparency. Some issues do not conveniently get a scandal to expose wrongdoings. This is when reformers and speakers are needed the most.
AXKTYKCT9NGHS	essay1	"I absolutely agree with this statement. The brain is a muscle, and must be exercised in order to stay in top shape. When people ignore this muscle, and instead use technology to solve their problems, one's ability to problem-solve on one's own deteriorates. This is especially true with skills that have previously been learned, but are then forgotten when they aren't used, like arithmetic. Most people spend much of their schooling on arithmetic, but when thrust into the ""real world"", where calculators or computer programs are used to solve problems, those arithmetic skills are all but forgotten. If the brain isn't used regularly, it becomes harder to think quickly and efficiently on a regular basis or without outside aid."
AXKTYKCT9NGHS	essay2	I don't agree with this statement. To get a complete view of society, one must study its rural populations, not its cities. It can be conceded that cities are where most of the development of a society begins, but the true characteristics of a society are found where life is slower. In rural areas, cultural heritage tends to be more visible and more important. In cities, there is a conglomeration of influences---both that of their own society, as well as others. In the country, the past is very much alive, and the past is where the true characteristics of a society are found.
AXKTYKCT9NGHS	essay3	Unfortunately, I believe this is true. Most people don't care about what's going on in the world, but they do care about drama. It takes effort to learn about an issue or problem, and the vast majority of the population doesn't want to put in the effort that is required. Drama, however, is easy to understand and can often be condensed in such a way that most people can understand it. Of course, this takes a very narrow and negative view of modern society. The most compelling example that would be able to challenge my position would be that of a speaker or reformer who brought attention to a problem better than or in absence of a scandal. This could be someone like Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement that helped to change the laws. He did this without scandal---but what if he had not been assassinated? Would change still have come?
AYKZ9H4BNW810	essay1	"There is no doubt some things will be lost by relying on technology. Memory is one of them for example as people now don't remember phone numbers. The question is are we losing something or just focusing our mind elsewhere? Technology means we don't need to know as much information as a person can easily obtain it. This makes moving forward as a society a lot easier as this spreads skills to a large population instead of having to rely on professionals.  So what are our minds doing now? Well, they are focused on more interesting things. People are now free to be more creative and focus on things they are actually interested in instead of what they ""need"" to know. Instead of deterioration, our minds are now flourishing due to having interest. There is downside though as people can forget how to learn because they are"
AYKZ9H4BNW810	essay2	Understanding a major city is an important part of a society, but it isn't everything. Learning everything about Beijing for example will tell you nothing about how bad China's impoverished areas are. Society is too rich and complex to only focus on a small part after all and should always be viewed as a whole. That being said, it is possible to get a good view of a society by looking at major cities as long as you keep in mind the comparison and contrasts of the society as a whole.
AYKZ9H4BNW810	essay3	Scandals can draw attention to areas, but they are often only for the short term. Very few scandals actually lead anywhere except to remove one person from power. Scandals misdirect where the attention should go in the end. If a very charismatic person steps in and tries to lead the people in the right direction, scandals can really help progress though. It gets people's interest to let the charismatic leader make the change we need. This makes it harder for people in charge to sweep it under the rug.
AYNWXFK66TKOZ	essay1	Technology is only aiding the human race in the acquisition of knowledge and not hindering it. Because we have access to endless information stored all over the internet we are better able to gain understanding about the world around us. Before the advent of the internet people primarily only had one another to rely on for much information. Information outside of the people around could only be attained by going to a library or seeking it from sources that were not always easy to obtain. Because of technology we can now gain a clear understanding of many things that we otherwise would never had a chance to know about.
AYNWXFK66TKOZ	essay2	If you go to any major city in the world you can learn a lot about the culture and people who live in that society just by observation. For example a large city in the United States will be full of shopping malls, strip malls, chain restaurants and other venues which emphasizes how much our society values capitalism. If you were to visit someplace in Japan in comparison you would notice that there is an emphasis on consumerism, but an attention to quality that the cities in the United States entirely lack. From products the society produces to the food that is made in any given city, a person can get a general sense of the people who inhabit that society.
AYNWXFK66TKOZ	essay3	If a scandal is exposed people will focus on it because in general there is always more of a focus on negative aspects of something rather than positives. For example in the United States politicians will often be involved in scandals which point out the hypocrisy of their words vs. the actions they have taken and tried to conceal. If someone is espousing virtues and then is caught in a lie, it speaks to how much they actually cared about an issue in the first place. Our attention is focused on the bigger issue because we can so clearly see how much other people have failed. We then try to examine our selves so that we do not appear to be hypocrites to others when we say that we car about an issue.
AZBH4LJ5SL456	essay1	I agree that with technology the ability of humans to think for themselves will deteriorate. You can already see it happening. With the use of calculators, students no longer have to do mental math. So many people lack the ability to do simple addition and subtraction in their heads, they can't even count change back properly. You also see it with the development of digital clocks. Young people find it more difficult to tell time with an analog clock. I believe it is going to get much worse. Younger people now don't have to go to the library to research anything, they pick up their smartphone and as Siri or Google whatever they need to know, and they receive an immediate answer. There is no learning involved.
AZBH4LJ5SL456	essay2	I do not completely agree that one must study major cities. Major cities have strong distinctions from smaller towns. I believe smaller towns have more important characteristics because they are more likely to take an interest in their neighbors. Smaller towns are more willing to help those in their communities that are homeless, hungry or struggling. In major cities, people focus on the bigger picture, while in smaller towns, people focus on the individual. In order understand the most important characteristics, I believe one must study major cities, as well as smaller communities.
AZBH4LJ5SL456	essay3	I strongly disagree with this claim. Scandals usually tell only the negative sordid details that the one telling wants you to hear. It doesn't focus on circumstances. Scandals simply cause division and mistrust. Unless there is an issue that is detrimental to society, we need to leave the past in the past or simply leave what's going on behind closed doors behind the door. We need to focus more on positive ways to build each other up rather than attempting to tear each other down.
AZKFOY6O5GND2	essay1	The primary function of technology is to assist humans. Technology will help the average person by making their routine day to day activities more manageable and enjoyable. At the same time, they will help professionals save massive amounts of time figuring out complex solutions to better human life even more. Relying on technology may make people more lazy, however people will still have their reasoning skills. The use of technology may even help improve our ability to think by coming across knowledge we'd probably never come across otherwise.
AZKFOY6O5GND2	essay2	Major cities are not the only part of society. Studying them will help define characteristics for major cities, with a few overlapping features from smaller cities and towns. We would need to study human interactions from all aspects of life to start to understand the important characteristics in a society. Seeing how people from different walks of life react and go through life will give a more thorough understanding of society.
AZKFOY6O5GND2	essay3	Scandals can be both good or bad. They are helpful assuming the scandal involves a situation showcasing a major issue that people otherwise would not encounter. However, scandals can also detract attention from other major issues. A lot of people are intrigued by scandals whether it pertains to them or not. It's very easy to capture the attention of people through scandals, but people choose to move beyond serious situations fast, and focus on comedy.
AZMOA8ONG0D2U	essay1	"It seems in this day and age people are getting ""smarter"" only to make themselves more lazy, and unaware to avoid personal connections. It seems the days of playing outside with GI Joes and Barbie dolls is over and staring at screens has taken over. This doesn't have to be the case. We could use this technology we harness to help people, from creating more food, to creating more effective ways to make the cost of living cheaper, and so on. Unfortunately, I think just like in dystopian scifi movies technology will be the death of us if were not careful, just like we shouldn't take our personal connections for granted we should rely so heavily on technology that technology itself decides enough is enough."
AZMOA8ONG0D2U	essay2	Throughout history people flock together to develop rapport and work together, these have since become known as major cities. No longer little tribes of aborigines, people from all cultures and walks of life come to big cities to try and make their lives better. But sometimes these major cities destroy people. Whether it be from racism, rape, violence or pride from being in the city longer than someone else, the natives feel don't belong. In other ways a big city can destroy an individual with drugs and alcohol. A city that operates 24 hours a day makes it easier for a newly confused and depressed person try to fit in and become dependent on these luxuries. Luxuries can become evil and being able to get anything you want at anytime of day or night makes it that much more difficult to resist.
AZMOA8ONG0D2U	essay3	Scandals can be a dramatic distraction from what really matters. Focusing on someones personal life simply because they are affluent, popular or both can deter the people from seeing what really matters. Sometimes these scandals need to be brought to the surface as in the case of men with power abusing minorities and corrupting the moral fabric of society. But when scandals get out of hand we need to make sure there isn't something else at play, like the enemies of said individual trying to take them down through lies and deceit. It's always best to look at scandals from all sides and angles so the populous doesn't drown in misinformation and go to war with each other over something that simply isn't even true.
AZOF6QSSWG98H	essay1	As people rely on more technology they will be able to think more for themselves than ever before.  The fact that we will be able to use technological advances to perform monotonous, mind numbing tasks will allow us to spend more time being creative.  By being able to be more creative, we will have more fun doing things we actually want to do and therefore solve some of the problems that technology is not able to solve yet.  The ability to think creatively is the key to thinking for yourself.  As more people have time freed up to do this, it will inspire others to move towards this direction.  As this happens we will see humans thinking for themselves go up exponentially.
AZOF6QSSWG98H	essay2	To understand important characteristics we must study the average of everyone.  It is true that there are more people in the major cities, such as Los Angeles, New York, Miami, etc.  At the same time there is almost an equal amount of people in the smaller cities and more rural areas.  This is evident almost every four years when we have a presidential election.  The electoral college vote can be very close as well as the popular vote.  The distinction is the fact that there are more republicans in rural areas and democrats in major cities.  Even though the characteristics of major cities are vastly different than rural cities, we must include a wider net to find the true characteristics of society.
AZOF6QSSWG98H	essay3	Scandals are not useful to society because we usually only notice them when they become too big to control.  Every scandal that we see in the news is usually regarding something got out of control and is either now impacting quite a few politicians, school officials or a group of people.  Larry Nassar was part of a scandal well before Michigan State settled for $500 million.  The potential Russian hacking was a scandal well before the election.  The #MeToo movement only became a movement after it became a scandal.  If there was only a couple of men that were miss treating women and it had been stopped, it would result in a much better outcome for everyone involved instead of making people suffer through deciding whether or not to go public with the information.  All in all, if someone is able to speak up and reform a situation before it becomes a scandal, less people are hurt and we would have more heroes.
AZZA3J049G7R5	essay1	I do understand the sentiment that because we rely so much with technology, our ability to think for ourselves are deteriorating. While on some people that may be true, but on a whole, and broader approach to things, as well as considering the problems and issues we will be facing in the future, some thinking and some task may be best tasked to machines and technology rather than humanity. Because humanity will need to face more important obstacles and hurdles to further improve on technology, such as space travel, gene repair, and so on. Unless humanity will move on from primitive issues and ideas, we will never move forward in facing forward-thinking issues of the future.
AZZA3J049G7R5	essay2	I do not agree that a society's characteristics can be determined by just studying its major cities. While it is true that major cities do make up majority of a country's population, it is by far not the only way of living, nor a representative of the uniqueness and the diversity a society can offer. Different ways of life, culture, cuisine, and many other aspects of a society can be mostly seen in rural and least populated areas. Major cities around the world fail to identify great differences that societies have and can often produce inaccurate results. It is outside of major cities where we can find rich characteristics and how cultures are defined throughout the entire human evolution.
AZZA3J049G7R5	essay3	One can be mislead into thinking that everything is going well and good around him and not be aware of what is really going underneath the surface. Unless an insider reveals an ongoing or a past morally wrong occurrence to an outsider, other members of the society may think that the occurrence is normal and maybe considered moral. Insiders may also be silenced and threatened with fear if ongoings inside a society will never be called out. It is just to be called out.
